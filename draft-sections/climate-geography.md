# Climate and water resources -- Status and importance

The average condition of atmosphere, which constantly keeps changing, in connection to particular part of land over a short period of time is called weather. However, climate signifies the average atmospheric phenomena over a course of some years thereby providing information on patterns like seasons, atmospheric pressure, wind movement, rainfall etc.

Climate is not as prone to changes as weather. For a given part of earth, the climate across multiple years is somewhat uniform. For a climate record, a long duration average condition of weather is taken into account. While informing on climate, certain features of weather such as rainfall and temperature are considered. Generally the mean values of weather parameters are stated together with the time duration over which those were recorded.


Climatology ?

Not every part of the world has same climate. study of climate is based on the components that define it -- solar radiation, atmospheric pressure, wind velocity, wind direction, humidity and rainfall. It is subject to shifts with changing latitudes as imparted by the changing condtion of the components of climate. As climate derives from weather parameters, it is liable to change with geographic features of land as well.

Some of the factors affecting climate are:

1. Latitude

It has an important role to play in condition of atmosphere at any place. Basically, as we move more northward or southward from the equator (the imaginary line segment dividing the globe into northern and southern hemisphere), the incident solar radition has lesser intensity and therefore the temperature drops significantly towards the poles. The equator passess through the 0 degree latitude. The solar radition incident at this location is almost perpendicular to the surface and has more energy per surface area than when incident upon higher latitudes, wherein insolation is much scattered.

2. Altitude

Earth's surface is not uniform and has various reliefs. With different elevations of surface the atmospheric states such air pressure and temperature of the location concomitant are different. In lower elevations, atmospheric pressure as well as temperature tends is higher while climbing to hills, we find lower atmospheric pressure and milder temperatures. If a region lies in great height, it is very likely that temperatures therein in cold. It is generally accepted that with increase in every 160 m in elevation, temperature drops by 1 degree C.

3. Distance from sea
4. Presence of hills and mountains
5. Nature of wind
6. Slope of land

Regions oriented towards the sea/ocean are generally humid while the slopes facing larger continent tends to be more dry and arid as well. Likewise the slopes orienting east or westward are warmer than those facing north or southward due to incidence of incoming solar radiation.
