## Judicial bodies

### Supreme court


### Ministry of Law and Justice

The Ministry of Law and Justice is part of the executive. It drafts bills, ordinances and executive orders, reviews and updates existing laws, and conducts research on the legal system and judicial administration. It provides legal opinions to the government and oversees the management of free legal aid, and it edits notices for publication in the Nepal Gazette. A semi-autonomous entity under the ministry, the Judicial Service Training Center, conducts pre-service, in-service, and other short training courses on the law for judicial service personnel.

### Judicial Service Commission

The Judicial Service Commission recommends appointments, transfers, and promotions of officers in the judicial service. However, it is the PSC that conducts examinations for appointment of class III judicial service officers. The functions of the Judicial Service Commission include recommending departmental actions and dismissals. The Chief Justice chairs the Commission, which includes the Minister for Law and Justice, a senior justice of the Supreme Court, the PSC chair, and the Attorney General. The Secretary of the Judicial Council is also the Secretary of the Commission.

In 2003, a public discussion program organized by the Commission suggested that the judicial service be consolidated to respond to the needs of judicial, law and government attorney offices. The Commission also recommended avoiding compartmentalization of services that complement each other. A separate service rule, independent of the civil service rule that governs the judicial service at the moment, was also recommended. Since there are major differences in perks, authority, and other service conditions of judges and judicial service officials, serving on the bench remains a major attraction.

### Nepal Bar Council

Legal professionals are registered under the Nepal Bar Council Act 1993. The Nepal Bar Council is a policy-making body responsible for conducting examinations for the bar. Lawyers in Nepal are classified as senior advocates, advocates, and pleaders. While senior advocates and advocates may practice in any court, pleaders can practice in courts other than the Supreme Court. In 2008 there were 12,329 licensed lawyers, including 976 women.50 Since then, the number of licensed lawyers has increased to 12,831 in July 2010.51 However, not all licensed lawyers practice law as only 54 senior advocates and 6,206 advocates had renewed their licenses.

### Nepal Police

The police force is a unit under the Ministry of Home Affairs. It was established by the Police Act 1956 to control and investigate crime and maintain law and order. When investigating a crime, the police may, with a court order, detain suspects for investigation. Upon completion of the investigation, the police submit a report and supporting evidence to the district attorney's office. The District Attorney, if satisfied with the report and the evidence, files a case in District Court. If not satisfied, the District Attorney can direct the police to investigate further. Investigations are arranged through the Department of Crime Control and Investigation. Police officers in the department can be transferred at any time, and this can affect investigations.

### Nepal Bar Association (NBA)

The NBA is a representative organization of Nepali legal professionals. It was established in December 1956 and later formalized under the National Guidance Act 1961. Government sponsored legal aid activities are conducted through this body, which has 79 units across the country.

### National Judicial Academy (NJA)

The NJA was established in 2004 to meet the training and research needs of judges, government attorneys, legal officers, private attorneys, and others directly involved in the administration of justice. It works under broad policy guidelines from a 16-member governing council headed by the Chief Justice, and includes a broad range of stakeholders - the Ministry of Law and Justice, the Office of the Attorney General, the law faculty at Tribhuvan University and the Nepal Bar Association, among others. The NJA seeks to increase knowledge and skills to promote effective, efficient, and accessible justice. An executive director heads the NJA, whose faculty members supervise the academic and research programs.

### Independence of the Judiciary

The 1990 constitution explicitly recognized the independence of the judiciary, and established the principles of extraordinary jurisdiction and judicial review of executive decisions. The Interim Constitution has preserved these provisions. Even prior to 1990, when the Supreme Court was not fully independent, there have been instances where the Supreme Court has used its power to interpret laws that contest with the interpretation of the executive. After 1990, however, the Supreme Court has exercised its independence, issuing judgments protecting personal liberty and human rights, and interpreting constitutional provisions. Judicial review of executive decisions and scrutinizing subordinate legislation for consistency with the constitution are other areas where the Supreme Court has a strong track record. One recent example was the Supreme Court's February 2006 decision declaring the Royal Commission for Corruption Control (RCCC) void. (King Gyanendra, who began ruling directly in February 2005, had formed the RCCC). That said, there have been other instances where the Supreme Court has been accused of violating the separation of powers by infringing the constitutional authority of the other branches of government.

### The judicial council

The Judicial Council oversees appointments, transfers and discipline of judges. The Judicial Service Commission manages judicial service personnel.

The Judicial Council enjoys broad authority over appointments, transfers, disciplinary actions and dismissal of judges. It maintains judges' personnel records and performance reports. The Council is a five-member body chaired by the Chief Justice and has its own secretariat. The Minister for Law and Justice, a senior judge of the Supreme Court, a senior member of the Bar and an independent lawyer are its members. However, the Council has occasionally been criticized for lack of impartiality among its members.

The other role of the Council is to maintain discipline in the judiciary. Of the 288 complaints lodged against judges from 1991 to 2003, 118 were found baseless upon preliminary investigation by the Council. It took action on 12 cases, and investigation continued on eight. It is unclear if the remaining complaints remained under investigation. There is also a discrepancy in the number of complaints: in 2009, the Council said there were 60 and the Supreme Court 55. The Council has been investigating several complaints alleging corrupt judges. The current draft amending the Judicial Council Act includes a provision for taking action against judges on charges of corruption even after retirement. The Council's advisory role in judicial administration has largely escaped its attention. Its activities are also hardly noticed by the public after the process of selection and appointment of judges is over.
