## Role of government

Generally, government refers to the executive arm of the state which is composed of the political executives, bureaucrats as well as other public services. We find some literatures using the words 'State' and 'Government' interchangeably in common discourse. Though these words have commonness and interrelatedness in use, they are non synonymous in terms of the coverage of meaning, intent and essence. In this regard, it is worthwhile to clarify the basic differences between these words. The political scientists define that a state is a human community that successfully claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory. Max Weber conceptualizes state as an autonomous organization with extraordinary means to dominate. Besides, the government is one of the components and an integral part of the state. It is a set of institutions that implements the functions of the state. State is a continuing, even permanent entity and is much extensive than the government.

The traditional concept about government was merely confined within the executive whereas modern political thinkers conceptualize it much broader with a foundation of an integrated and cooperative form and functions of the three organs of the state. In a simplest form, 'government' can be defined as integrated, mutual and cooperative efforts of the state organs to execute day-to-day affairs of state for the well being of its citizens.

Though 'government' is one of the inseparable components of a state, there have been diverse opinions regarding the role and scope of it. Different views came into light in favor or against the active role of government. In this context, it is worth mentioning that the debates mainly emerged in early 1970s. and was in climax in early 1990s. These debates were more or less related to the maximalist or minimalist role of the state and government; and also contributed some supportive as well as paradoxical justifications; but the question has yet to be convincingly answered.

In this respect, the concept like Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) during 1970s; and New World Order, Minimal State and Good Government during the 1990s have gained much enormity as a part of globalization and liberalization.

Ideological backdrop

There are mainly two different schools of thought regarding the role and scope of the government. Marxist perspective highlights state as an instrument of the domination of one class over others, stressing particularly its coercive character. They advocate that the totality of the production relation constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation on which arises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond different forms of social consciousness. The followers of Marxism advocate for the active role of the state and government for resolving class struggle and maintaining equality and welfare.


The second set of guidelines was neo-liberal ideology which basically advocated for minimal role of the state and government but active role of market mechanism. The critical period from the late 1970s to the early 1990s witnessed a major upsurge in the neo-liberal ideas concerning the development process and development strategy. The emerging neo-liberal orthodoxy supported a new development model based on the primacy of individualism, market liberalism, outward orientation and state contraction. The organizing principle of neo-liberal political economy was the notion of a minimal state whose principle role was confined to that of securing law and order, macroeconomic stability and the provision of physical infrastructures.

Basic principles of defining the role of government

According to the political scientists, the followings are the guiding principles regarding the role of the government -

i. Theory of welfare state: This is a concept of government where state plays a primary role in protection and promotion of the economic and social well-being of its citizens. It is based on principles of equality of opportunity, equitable distribution of wealth and public responsibility for those unable to avail themselves of the minimal provisions for a better life.
ii. Theory of laissez-faire: This theory accentuates the role of market rather than the monopolistic role of the government. It explains that not the government intervention or monopoly but the competition assures optimization of people's welfare.
iii. Theory of economic rationalism: Rationing is the controlled distribution of scarce resources, goods, or services. This theory stresses that the government should allocate available resources in a fair and justifiable way.
4. Factors determining the role of government
Scholars have suggested the following basic determinants regarding the scope & role of government -
a. Provision of public goods: The provision of non-rival and non-excludable goods should be maintained by the government. A government needs to be strong enough to provide public goods even if the private sectors and market mechanisms fail to collaborate.
b. Stage of development: In the initial stage of development, the government intervention through centrally directed planning, programming and investments is considered necessary in terms of better allocation of scarce resources. Likewise, government needs to have active role to foster private sectors until they are developed into holding the responsibility effectively.
c. System of government: Market economy, private ownership, liberalization and minimal intervention by government are emphasized in capitalism whereas socialism emphasizes the dominant role of the government.
d. Development policy: Centrally controlled development policy demands for active role of the government whereas participatory development policy demands only the facilitating and mediating role.
e. State capacity and institutions: The government has to bear its responsibilities for assuring well-being of citizens even if other non-state actors are not capable to collaborate. Likewise, active role of the government is yet unavoidable and valid if institutional set ups are inefficient and weak.
f. Social justice and equity: This is one of the core functions of the government that the deprived and marginalized segments of society should be protected, preserved and promoted to ensure social justice and equity.


Rethinking the role of government: Driving forces

There is no doubt that the wave of globalization is the main factor for a shift in the role and scope of government. The role and functions of the government have been transformed substantially along with the emergence and expansion of globalization and liberalization. In terms of dealing with the effects of globalization, two different perspectives have been developed: globalization from above and globalization from below. The first one refers to a borderless world characterized by a unified global economy, global government, homogeneous global cultures, and by implication of a global system of public administration. And, globalization from below denotes people's active participation at the grass root level in the areas like democracy, decentralization, human rights, women's empowerment, decision making and benefit sharing. This approach advocates for lessening the intervention of government and nurturing effective role of people's organizations.

Globalization and privatization significantly lessens the ability of the state and its government to exercise its influence on social and economic development as well as the ability of the government to be the major provider of essential goods and services such as health, education, utilities, etc. As a by-product of globalization, privatization and deregulation moves the governmental role from that of a provider of basic utilities to the regulator and from monopolist to an advocate of consumer interest through the promotion of a competitive environment.

Along with globalization effect, Washington Consensus (WC) had appeared as a universal policy proposal by the Brettonwood Institutions like World Bank and IMF in 1970s to pursue a systematic programme of decreasing state's involvement in the economy through trade liberalization, privatization reducing public spending and freeing key relative prices. In its theme, the state itself was conceived as a problem rather than the solution. The logical corollary of this line of thinking was that the cost of 'government failures' associated with excessive protectionism would always outweigh market failures associated mostly with imperfect competition and under provision of public goods. Hence, increasingly the WC was based on the understanding that imperfect markets are always superior to imperfect and inefficient government.

By the beginning of 1990s, the Washington Consensus itself was under serious challenge. The question arose whether it was possible to deal effectively with issues regarding unemployment, poverty reduction and even more challenging distributional issues through growth alone without considering the ownership structure. Therefore, the state's active role was once again considered vital to address these issues; and the Post -Washington Consensus (PWC) elucidated its rationale. Whilst the PWC favoured liberalization of the economy and greater reliance on the market; state and markets are conceived of as complements rather than substitutes. The PWC provides a significant improvement over the WC and draws attention to its failure to provide a sufficiently broad framework for dealing with key and pressing development issues such as income distribution, poverty reduction and self-sustained growth.

Moreover, reconsideration of the role of the government intensified more when Osborne and Gaebler came up with new perspective in their book, 'Reinventing Government', in 1992. According to them, the basic principles for reinventing government are steering rather than rowing, empowering rather than serving, injecting competition into service delivery, transforming rule-driven organizations, funding outcomes, meeting the needs of the customers not the bureaucracy, earning rather than spending, from hierarchy to participation and teamwork; and leveraging change through market.

Rationale for effective role of government

Generally speaking, government is the first as well the final resort of the citizen; and the effectiveness of the government is judged by the quality of goods and services provided for the well-being of the people. Although there is an emerging consensus that the executive arm is still central in many countries in promoting economic and social development, it must not continue to play the role of a universal provider. Rather it should assume a new role of a partner, catalyst and a facilitator.

Market, as the neo-liberalist argues, cannot function evenly and perfectly all the time. Moreover, it is non-existing in some developing countries. Market failures are considered as inevitable and they need to be corrected by active state intervention. An effective government is vital for promotion of goods and services and the rules and institutions that allow markets and other private sectors to flourish. The goal of the government is to optimize welfare whereas market mechanism seeks for maximizing profit. Likewise, the government intervention is expected to check the natural monopoly. Though their goals are contradictory, the collaboration between the state and non-state actors is vital for sustainable growth and development. The distributional justice cannot be optimized by market alone. In this light, the rationale for effective role of government can be validated by the following points:
- to correct the market failure,
- to provide public goods and services,
- to materialize the objectives of the welfare state,
- to ensure social justice and equity,
- to protect and promote the vulnerable and marginalized segment of society,
- to protect the interest and the mandate of citizens,

Today, the government is not in a position to do everything on its own. With the emergence of so many non-state actors in globalization context, the government's role, irrespective of any ideology or perspective, is becoming more crucial mainly in the core sectors of the economy. As globalization has pressurized the retreat of the government from its conventional role, the non-state actors such as private sectors, NGOs, voluntary agencies, self-help groups, civil societies and CBOs are automatically getting emboldened to explore new and different avenues of the development agendas. But at the same time, there are some core functions which the government does not have to get away from its primary responsibility. The government is expected to ensure that the benefits of policy outcomes reach up to the poor and results in lessening poverty and inequality so that the fruits of growth can be shared by all the strata of the population.

Decentralization, de-bureaucratization and deregulation are adding the importance not only of local government, but also of non-state actors on whom significant functions are devolved or outsourced. At the same time, a range of tasks and policy decisions, traditionally handled by national bureaucracies in their respective capitals, is being increasingly transposed to an inter-governmental or supranational level as a result of increased flows between countries of goods, capital, labour and information. The government is the hub of activities connecting multiple partners and stakeholders from varied fields, regions, cultures, occupations, professions and interests.

However, the irreducible minimum roles of the government are to keep peace, enforce law and order, maintain foreign relation, revenue administration and assure a stable environment. In addition to this, government of this era has to perform the following core functions, too -
- Setting regulatory and legal frameworks,
- Creating effective institutions,
- Maintaining the provision of infrastructure for private sectors through regulatory actions,
- Creating enabling and fostering environment,
- Setting incentive structures and reward system,
- Ensuring transparency and accountability,
- Promoting competition,
- Ensuring social justice,
- Ensuring democratic governance,
- Monitoring and evaluating the development results,

The question is no longer big or small government but enough and efficient government to accomplish maximum welfare of society. Government's role now is considered an enabler of growth and progress rather than an obstacle-creator to it. In any event, the size of the government cannot be discussed in isolation from an assessment of the population preferences concerning the role and effectiveness of government action. A very small government can still be too large if it is inefficient and wasteful; and a large government can still justify its expansion if the citizens wish it to undertake additional tasks and has demonstrated its effectiveness. There is a growing consensus that governments can play a vital role in successful development efforts, but it can be recognized that the wrong kind of government intervention can be highly detrimental. Rethinking and redefining the role of the government does not mean lessening its role; rather it means reinvigorating and seeking for more effective roles. In this era, the government must do only the things which it can do well. As government's role cannot be undermined; it has both bright side and dark side.

- Increases current expenditure,
- Increases the influence of the vested interest groups and elite capture,
- Reduces the efficiency and performance of the government.
- Market mechanisms cannot work properly,

Nepalese context

Historical background

In spite of its efforts for years in the past, Nepal's development is still in the initial stage. With the objectives of poverty reduction and balanced growth, Nepal had implemented 'Integrated Rural Development Projects', which were induced in the assistance of the donors. It can be traced out that planned development process initiated in 1956 was one of the key treads with a purpose to allocate scarce resources rationally for a balanced development. Planned development effort, however, has not only been helping to envisage major goals and objectives but also channelizing resources for development. National development plans (i.e. periodic plans) are regarded as the broader development vision of the state and government. Basically, the central role is accomplished by the government in planning; a number of modalities have been adopted to ensure the participation of the non-state actors and stakeholders in formulation and implementation process.

The role of the state and the government had been dominant in the Nepalese economy until 1970s. As the economy was unleashed along with the adoption of SAP programme during 1980s, the focus had been basically given to ease foreign investment and to liberalize the financial sectors. Moreover, priority had also been put to privatization of underperforming state-owned enterprises for reducing public spending. The objective of all these efforts was to take a path to outward orientation so as to support for high economic growth and balanced development; which would ultimately put impact on poverty reduction.

The effects of the global trends in redefining the role of the government signalled explicitly after 1990s. The conditions of the SAP programme themselves were liberalization of the economy for macroeconomic stability. By then, the concern about scope of the government had been debatable in the national policy context. And, this has been taking into consideration of the development policy agendas and issues. Likewise, a number of round table discussions and debates, both nationally and internationally, had been taken place during Nepal's attempt to be the member of the WTO. The terms and conditions that Nepal had to fulfil as a to-be member of the WTO were mainly related to redefine the role of the government and economic liberalization.

Guiding Policies

The Interim Constitution of Nepal, 2063 has envisaged the collaborative roles of the state and non-state actors for the economic development of the country. The government, cooperatives and the private sectors are considered as three pillars for the execution of the national development activities. This provision clearly signifies an invigorating role of the government.

The Tenth Five Year Plan (2059- 2064), which is also regarded as PRSP, had distinctly defined the role of the government, private sectors, NGOs and the civil society. As mentioned in the plan document, the government was to play the role as a regulator, catalyst, facilitator and promoter. Moreover, it had also been envisioned that the government should be creating supportive and conducive environment and promotional schemes for encouraging the private sectors whereas the private sector was supposed to cooperate with the government by investing to produce quality goods and services. Besides, the civil society would have to work for social mobilization and stakeholders' effective participation.

The Administrative Reform Commission, 2048B.S. had recommended that the government should only be concentrated on functions like policy formulation, regulation and monitoring and evaluation. Likewise, the commission had envisaged that the government should loosen its monopolistic roles; and the non-core public affairs should be undertaken by the private sectors and market mechanism by means of privatization and contracting out.

Local Self-Governance Act, 2055B.S. has emphasized the effective role of local government rather than the central one by means of devolution of power. Active participation of the stakeholders in the process of decision making and benefit sharing at the local level as well as the provision of users' group have also been highlighted so as to ensure ownership and sustainability of development programmes. This act has provisioned for an autonomous local government to execute local activities under the supervision of the central government. The Civil Service Act, 2049B.S. has also acknowledged the role of the private sector; and marked out that some positions in civil service are to be fulfilled by service contract. Moreover, Public Procurement Act, 2063B.S. and Regulation Act 2064B.S.have stipulated a number of models for contracting out of the public activities to private sector. Besides, recently formulated BOT policy has also incorporated a number of bidding models for providing quality goods and services on behalf Of the government by non-state actors. All these evidences suggest that considerable policy initiatives as well as practices have been put in place regarding the minimal but more effective role of the government in Nepal.

Prevailing role of the government in Nepal: An assessment

Evidence from different countries, especially the East Asian, has revealed that economic liberalization and outward-orientation contributes significantly to economic growth by means of enhanced trade competitiveness, foreign investment and export promotion. The private sectors in these countries are observed to be so strong that they are capable to take any kind of responsibility; and they have already gained much trust from citizens. In the Nepalese context, we can hardly notice any remarkable leap in economic growth even though we already have decade's long liberalization practice.

Though, it is said that Nepalese economy is liberalized, the government's control over economy is still significant. On the one hand, the market mechanism has not been able to function well due to a number of distortions. On the other hand, private sectors are not well strengthened so as to collaborate effectively with the government. Besides, the private sectors in Nepal are not found sincere enough in fulfilling their public responsibility and accountability. So, this has created a problem that government cannot be fully convinced by the private sectors and to rely on them for public sector management.

Development experts suggest that central planning agency (in our context NPC) has only to be concentrated on setting broad national development goal through indicative planning; and to facilitate the concerned agencies to formulate sectoral plans. Development planning experiences in Nepal show that our planning process is almost centralized and top-down so that stakeholders' participation is only symbolic.

In spite of decades long efforts for decentralization in Nepal; the practical aspect has always been questionable. Centre's reluctance to devolve power and responsibility and fragile capacity of the local government are regarded as main hindrances for materializing decentralization policy in Nepal.

Public sector in Nepal is too bulky so that the current expenditure from public treasury has been increasing. Even the government does not have reasonable answer why more than three dozen state-owned enterprises are currently run by the government whereas their productivity is quite lower and most of them are in loss.

Besides, it can also be noticed that the government in Nepal has been involved in such minor activities which the private sectors could do better. It is beyond justification that many central agencies in Nepal, which are basically set up for policy and M and E functions, have been involved in implementing some small projects. This, on the one hand, has reduced the government efficiency and discouraged the private sectors. On the other hand, the government has not been able to pay due attention to the sectors for which it is supposed to do. Moreover, the trend of deteriorating governance and development indicators also show that the public sectors and the government institutions have been losing their strengths. Market failure has been frequent but the government's efforts have not been effective enough to correct it. The private sector has been de-motivated and some have even withdrawn due to political instability and transition.

Conclusion

The conventional role of the government as a provider has significantly been changed into a catalyst in this era of internationalization. This dynamism demands for effective role of the government rather than interventionary role. Though the primary responsibility of the government is to optimize the welfare of its citizen, it has also to create an 'even platform' and an enabling environment for private enterprises, individual innovation and creativity and social action. So, today's government should act as a regulator, facilitator, promoter and coordinator. De-bureaucratization, decentralization, deregulation and privatization are some tools for reinvigorating and revitalizing government's role in the modern state to foster high economic growth, social justice and sustainable development.

'Minimal role' is characterized by democratic, proactive, mission-driven and effective government. Strong and committed government is necessary to ensure social justice, protect the vulnerable segments of society, ensure empowerment and mainstreaming of marginalized segments of society; and ensure a more equitable distribution of the benefits.
