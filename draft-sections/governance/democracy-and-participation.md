## Democracy and participation

### Basic features of Democracy

In recent years, the world is witnessing the popularity of democracy as the "primary vehicle for the fulfilment of individual aspirations, the articulation of interests and the nurturing of civil society" (Cheema and Maguire 2002: 10). The basic features of democracy, as Juan Linz and Alfred Stepan (ibid: 17) argue, demands the existence of the following five inter-related conditions.

a) A free and lively civil society
b) A relatively autonomous and valued political society
c) The rule of law to guarantee citizens' freedoms and independent associational life
d) A functioning state bureaucracy which can be used by the democratic government
e) An institutionalized economic society.

According to Cheema and Maguire, there are two fundamental underlying rationales of democracy which, of course, are equality and liberty. They add that certain minimum conditions must be met in order for a system to be labelled as 'democratic.' These include, among others, and in no particular order, respect for human rights and the rule of law, collective deliberation, choice and participation and representative and accountable government. "Democracy is generally understood to denote a system of government, the distribution of power within that system and the grounded rules of and values inherent in the process. Democratization, in turn, is understood to be the process whereby democratic institutions, practices and beliefs are inbuilt and/or strengthened in a society. This includes fostering the participation of citizens in the democratic process. Participation can be ensured through formal mechanisms such as elections or through informal mechanisms such as civil society organisations" (ibid: 17-18)

Molutsi (2002: 70) argues that democracy should be defined by its basic principles or values and more importantly, how these works in the practice. He outlined two-fold democratic principles as below:

1. Popular control over public decision making and decision makers

2. Equality between citizens in the exercise of that control
These are the principles that democrats in all times and places have struggled for while retaining popular control over public decisions even as they fight for an end of the monopoly of the elite in decision-making and reaping its benefits, overcoming obstacles surrounding gender, ethnicity, religion, language, class, wealth with a view to equalise exercise of citizenship rights. Molutsi says:  "democracy is thus not an all-or nothing affair, but a matter of degree to which the people can have their influence over public policy and policy-makers while enjoying equal treatment and having their voices heard equally."

The democratic principles outlined above are broad and therefore require to be specified more precisely in the context of a system of representative government in which the people assign the right to decide public policy to their representatives on their own behalf. Molutsi describes sets of mediating values (Table) that are necessary through which these democratic principles are realized in practice. These values include the values of participation, authorization, representativeness, accountability, transparency, responsiveness and solidarity.

Main democratic values (Column 1 of the Table) are derived from two democratic principles -- popular control and equality (as discussed above). The second column spells out the specific requirements for these values to be effective in the light of reality and practice. The third column lists the typical institutions through which these requirements (outlined in column two) can be met in a system of representative government in particular country. According to Molutsi (2002: 71-72) based on these values, representative governments derive their democratic character, and these values can be used, in turn, to assess how democratically the democratic institutions work in practice.

Cheema and Maguire (2002: 73) argue: "democracy is a question of degree, not an all-or nothing situation which a country has or do not have." Therefore, the notion of assessment process is to be framed in the comparative model (How much? How far? etc.) They propose a framework for assessing democracy along with broad categories of key indicators, which are:

- Citizenship
- Rule of law
- Civil and political rights
- Economic and social rights
- Free and fair elections
- Democratic rule of political parties
- Government effectiveness and accountability
- Civilian control with military and police
- No corruption
- The media in democratic society
- Political participation
- Government responsiveness
- Decentralization
- International dimension of democracy

Molutsi explains that issue of inclusiveness, participation and partnership, sustainability and process orientation are critical for a successful process of democratisation and argues the dialogue between the leaders and their people to be the only efficient mechanism to translate constitutional provisions and institutional frameworks of democracy into culture and practice.

### Why elected officials represents people's interests ?

Cheema and Maguire (2002: 18) explain the following four reasons of representing the interests of people by representative governments:

1. The public spirit of those who offer themselves for public service,
2. The use of their vote by citizens to select candidates with identical interests and devotion to public service while in office,
3. Citizens' use of their votes to remove those 'who would stray from the path of virtue',
4. The separation of government powers through a system of checks and balance in such ways that, together, they end up acting in the people's best interest.

However, making the claim of representing people's interest is a highly controversial issue. How does one make sure that political freedom and electoral participation of the people ensures true representation of the people ? In this context, Manin Przeworski and Stokes (in Cheema and Maguire 2002: 18) argue: "citizens' control over politicians is at best highly imperfect in most democracies - and elections are not a sufficient mechanism to ensure that governments will do everything they can do to maximize the citizen's welfare."

The question which arises then, is what is the best political system in which political representatives truly represent the citizen's voice? Cheema and Maguire (2002: 19) argue, "though democracy is still more conducive to representation than other types of regimes, institutional reforms and innovations can promote a more inclusive democracy - a form of government in which needs and demands of the poor, minorities, and other disadvantaged groups are adequately represented." They, however, caution, "there is no guarantee that democratic development moves in only one direction and there is much to suggest that all political systems (including democracies, liberal or otherwise) become rigid, corrupt and unresponsive in the absence of periodic reform and renewal" (ibid: 19).

Cheema and Maguire conclude, "Democratic governance is the best system to ensure citizen participation in decision-making because it demands the participation of the citizens in selecting their leaders and holding them accountable. It also provides local governance and civil society mechanisms through which citizens can voice their concerns; make decisions at a local level and inform their elected representatives of pressing issues" (ibid: 31).

Democracy and Sharing of Power Through Participation


Participation: concepts and principals

Participation is a way of sharing power with different stakeholders. If power is not shared properly, there is no real participation. However, participation in a broader term conveys different meanings to different persons and it is highly context-dependent. This study covers the following major dimensions of participation:

1. Participation in a democratic system: It is called participatory democracy in simple terms. Decision-making through democratic exercises including free and fair elections, legislative control, sharing of political power through different democratic institutions are the basic elements of participatory democracy. In such system, people take part in the decision-making process through election. This is what in general terms Western societies widely understand as democracy and participation. However, such situation in true sense does not exist in most developing countries.

2. Participation of civil society organisations like media, private sector organisations, NGOs, community based organisations, including participation of the citizens in governance-related affairs particularly at the local level.

The first dimension of participation denotes the macro-level perspectives of democracy and participation, which provides a political as well as institutional framework for participation and democratic governance at national and local level. The second dimension of participation operates under the institutional framework given by the participatory democracy.

Participation and decentralisation

Participation is the basic feature of any form of democratic government. With the advancement of the globalization process and the increasing consciousness of freedom, human rights and democratic values have been creating increasing pressures for greater participation in public affairs. Consequently, the role of the state in the economic, political and social domains, as well as the concept of public management has been changing in many ways. There have been growing governance concerns in which the state, the private sector and civil society have important roles to play in the promotion of democracy and development. Therefore, collaboration and partnerships among development partners are essential in many areas to advance democratic and development goals of the state (UN 2002: 4).

Participation and decentralisation are closely related concepts and have symbiotic relationships. Successful decentralisation requires local participation. Proximity of local government to constituents alone will enable them to respond better to local needs and efficiently match public spending to private needs. Furthermore, the process of decentralisation can itself enhance the opportunities for participation by placing more power and resources at the more easily influenced levels of government. In a political environment having poor traditions of citizen participation, decentralisation can be an important first step in creating regular predictable opportunities for citizen-state interaction (WB 2004). 

This symbiotic relationship between decentralisation and participation leads to preparing policy frameworks. Here mechanisms for citizen participation could be considered a helpful pre-condition when evaluating the prospects for successful decentralisation. Inferentially, the design of decentralisation should take into account the opportunities and limitations imposed by existing channels of local participation. Compare this with the lack of participatory mechanisms which could be considered a motivation for decentralisation and could help create local demand for more participatory channels to voice local preferences. Thus participation can be taken to be both a means to successful decentralisation and a goal of decentralisation to a certain extent. Hence while designing decentralisation policies, these informational imperfections need to be taken into account so as to try and improve the depth and degree of citizen participation in local government action. Local government responsiveness, one of the main rationales for decentralisation, cannot be realized when there are no mechanisms for transferring information between the local government and its constituents (ibid).

Citizen Participation and Inclusive Democracy

There are two dominant opinions in the contemporary literature in favour of direct citizen participation in governance affairs in the context of democratic political environment. One of the strongest arguments in favour of direct participation of the citizen in governance activities is that it contributes to promoting democracy by making government more responsive in ways far more effective than the traditional form of representative democracy (IDS 2004: 3). Another argument for participation is the citizens' fundamental right. Here the right to participate in governance is seen as a premise rather than a favour provided by the government. It allows citizens to claim further rights and entitlements. In this respect, citizen participation becomes more than a technical fix as it helps effective delivery of public goods and services with more sustainable impacts. Citizens can engage in governance activities directly or indirectly backing the voice of larger population that more likely is excluded in formal political affairs. Thus direct citizen participation in governance promotes a healthy and inclusive democracy in ways far more effective than the traditional forms of representative democracy.

The participation in governance increases the degree of accountability of responsible authorities towards local people. "In several of the countries studied, [...] accountability mechanisms, introduced through law are serving as important vehicles for enhancing representative democracy" (Edwards and Hulme 1995: 8 in McGee et al. 2003: 12). "Ability to demand and exercise accountability implies power. The right to demand and the capacity and willingness to respond to calls for accountability assumes relations of power. Indeed, the very function of accountability is to ensure that those that wield power on behalf of others are answerable for their conduct. [...] these power relations are in a state of flux, reflecting the contested basis of relations between the state, civil society and market actors" (Newell and Bellour 2002: 1 in McGee et al. 2003: 12).

Edwards discusses accountability in relation to particular forms of democracy. "Accountability to a constituency [.] is the 'bedrock' of representative democracy, requiring formal procedures like elections to ensure that decisions are fairly reached'. On the other hand, "Voicing an opinion is the bedrock of participatory democracy (we used to call it freedom of speech) and those who speak out do not need to be formally representative of a constituency" (McGee et al. 2003: 12).

Promotion of citizen participation, however, is not achieved in the absence of the necessary policy framework, political freedom and appropriate functional mechanisms in place by which citizens can effectively influence governments to develop responsive policies, and to implement responsive programs and services. "It embodies the idea that citizens can help themselves; that they can articulate their own needs and find the solutions to address them; that they can be active participants rather than mere recipients of development processes; that development works better for them if done bottom-up rather than from the top-down" (IDS 2004: 2).


The role of political parties and civil society in participation and democracy

Political parties and civil society both play vital roles in deepening participation and democracy. Political parties are important vehicles responsible for articulating and aggregating the diverse needs and demands of the society. Political parties compete for political power and have the ability to directly translate these diverse demands into public policy. In this context, political parties develop positions on a wide range of issues and approach those from an ideological standpoint. Thus, vibrant political parties are the key to effective citizen participation, multi-party system and democratic governance. "[.] political parties are directly involved in the electoral process, the functioning of the legislature, the promotion and protection of human rights, anti-corruption strategies, decentralisation and local governance systems and governance in crisis and post-crisis situations" (Cheema and Maguire 2002: 40-41).

Civil society organisations, which connect individuals with the public realm and the state are the key to democratic governance. They can play vital roles in promoting democracy in many ways. Firstly, these represent different voices, perspectives and values in a pluralist society. Secondly, civil societies can provide checks and balance to government power and monitor social abuses and these can offer opportunities for people to develop their strengths and capacities. Thirdly, civil society organisations are often issue based so that they can act as stimulating forces for positive social change (ibid: 40).

To summarise, it is clear from the above discussion that citizen participation in public affairs is a must to make public sector more effective, efficient, accountable and furthermore, to operationalise the democratisation process in the long-run.

### Different modes of citizen participation

Participation can be categorized into broad categories based on the degree of participation (Table). In all different categories, there are three basic levels or categories of participation - indirect participation (starting point), direct participation (middle level) leading towards joint actions and ownership (highest level).

In the specific context of citizen participation in processes of policy-making or political decision-making, the basic ladder can be elaborated to show what forms information-sharing, consultation, joint decision-making, and initiation and control by stakeholders might assume in that particular context. Firstly, what is referred to as 'participation' sometimes consists of no more than the provision of information from one actor to others, with the latter referred to as participation and often consists of one actor consulting others on their views without any obligation to incorporate the views expressed. Secondly, the power relations between 'participation' or stakeholders and the politically transformative potential of their interaction differ considerably between one level of intensity and another.

To summarise, meaningful participation of the citizens can only be ensured when citizens deepen their involvement in the process to the extent that their needs are translated into tangible outputs and outcomes which directly affect their lives.


### Enabling and constraining factors of citizen participation

For meaningful participation in local governance, it is equally important that there should be an appropriate mechanism that encourages greater voice initiatives on the one hand and effective responsiveness in public institutions on the other. Olowu (2003: 49) prescribes the following as necessary conditions for effective citizen voicing: 

a) broad membership base and alliance, 
b) technical knowledge, 
c) official's knowledge on policy discourses, 
d) ability to effectively mobilize the media, 
e) social capital, where trust and mutual support has been built, 
f) horizontal coalitions with other bodies, 
g) formal standing in policy making arenas and in oversight agencies, 
h) statutory rights to know and rights to redress.

Enabling and constraining factors from legal perspective is very critical to promote citizen participation. The characteristics are summarized (Table).
Despite the legislative framework, there are some contextual factors (historic and cultural setting, the nature and background of the actors, etc.) that are critical to the citizen participation. These factors, as McGee et al. (2003: 63-64) note, are summarised in Table.

Evidently, it is clear from the conceptual discussion outlined above that the notion of the participation concept in governance which is recently being used denotes much wider meaning than the traditional political participation. Participation in governance context means accepting citizen's greater influence in day-to-day governance activities which affect their life directly or indirectly. Therefore, it is much broader and inclusive than the traditionally defined political participation which was limited, in most cases, to voting rights. Healey prescribes collaborative planning as a tool to promote citizen participation and inclusive democratization process with greater accountability (Healey 1997: 200). Then a question which comes up here is: which type of political or governance system is most favourable to the best involvement of people in governance activities? The following sections discuss these critical issues.


### Participation in direct and representative democracy

Different forms of democracy determine their associated sets of actors and their role also differs based on the modalities which has direct implications on the degree of citizen participation and the power sharing. Edwards (2002: 3 in McGee et al. 2003: 13) points out that, "while both direct and participatory democracy and electoral (representative) democracy are needed if politics is to function in the public interest, participatory democracy is the 'natural territory' of NGOs whereas representative democracy is the natural territory of governments. These distinct identifications no doubt partially explain the gradual and hesitant character of progress towards enhancing democracy as a whole, or democratic local governance more specifically, by rendering it more participatory" (McGee et al. 2003: 13).

Contemporary literatures emphasize on direct democracy as the most favourable political system for better citizen participation. In this context, Gross and Kaufmann note: "Direct democracy is in which citizens have the right and opportunity [.] to be directly involved in formulating and passing the laws and/or the constitution of their countries" (Gross and Kaufmann 2002: 1 in McGee et al. 2003: 7-8). Further arguments for direct democracy are noted by McGee et al. as they add: "Direct democracy is often considered the purest form of democracy and it is contrasted with representative democracy. Representative democracy offers citizens less control than other forms. Direct democracy as a whole offers citizens greater control than representative democracy, but certain forms of it offer them other advantages too" (McGee et al. 2003: 8-9). Thus in direct democracy, there are concerns for much wider involvement of the citizens in decision-making through different mechanisms than other forms of democratic system.

Bucek and Smith give another set of arguments for citizen participation by differentiating direct democracy from participatory democracy. They emphasize participatory democracy and note, "Participatory democracy can be differentiated from direct democracy in terms of outcome and also in terms of their representative roles in decision-making. Participatory democracy denotes contexts of direct democracy where mechanisms for political participation are used to provide possibilities for the enrichment of local political and administrative life as well as for improvements in the responsiveness of public service to the needs of citizen" (Bucek and Smith 2000: 15 in McGee et al. 2003: 8-9).

McGee et al. also agree that participatory democratic forms involve citizens in decisionmaking and deliberation processes although they do not usually lead to formal and final decisions. They argue that participatory democracy is better than representative democracy in revealing people's preferences (McGee et al. 2003: 8-9). Edwards describes that both forms are to be complemented for effective participation. He notes: "Neither approach, however, is desirable in its pure form without elements of the other: without sustained public pressure (as in participatory democracy), governments rarely fulfil the promises they make on election day. But without election, it is difficult to reconcile the different interests and agendas that exist in civil society" (Edwards 2002: 3 in McGee et al. 2003: 9).

McGee et al. (2003) lay further emphasis on participatory democracy that has particular resonance in southern countries. They note: "It includes those countries where formally 'representative' democratic systems have co-existed with extreme inequality and deprivation, rests on the charge that in inequitable societies representative systems will inevitably reproduce social, economic and political inequities in terms of who can engage with and influence decision-making." It has been argued that the problem with representative democracy is not so much that it restricts citizen involvement to vote, but that "the opportunities it creates for more extensive involvement and influence over decision-making are dependent upon a variety of resources, most notably time, money and education that are distributed unevenly between different sections of the population. In this way, the freedoms of speech and association may expand political activity beyond the vote, but at the same time these practices are also the means whereby the inequalities of civil society are transmitted to the political domain" (Beetham 1992 in Abrahamsen 2000: 75 in McGee et al. 2003: 9).

Cornwall and Gaventa (2001: 32 in McGee et al. 2003: 10) argue that such inequalities can be minimized through the participatory and deliberative process by focusing on poor people exercising their voice through inclusion, consultation and/or mobilization. Similarly, Fung and Wright argue for empowered participatory democracy and emphasize redesigning and redefining of democratic institutions "to incorporate innovations that elicit the energy and influence of ordinary people, often drawn from the lowest strata of society in the solution of problems that plague them" (Fung and Wright 2001: 6-7 in McGee et al. 2003: 10). 

McGee et al. describe the concept of deliberation as a mechanism that enriches participatory democracy. Fung and Wright (2001: 6-7 in McGee et al. 2003: 10) define deliberation as the instituting of 'reason-based decision-making'. McGee et al. note: "The promotion of deliberation arises from concerns both with citizen's right to participate and with what democracy can do for people as well as what people can do for democracy: deliberative democracy emphasizes eliciting broad public participation in a process which provides citizen an opportunity to consider the issues, weigh alternatives, and express a judgement about which policy or candidate is preferred" (McGee et al. 2003: 10). "While participatory, empowered and deliberative democracies are evermore current terms in political science and governance debates, yet they are but aspirations. No country can claim to have instated fully participatory democracy. Most are starting from a representative democratic system and have begun to introduce modifications to this system which render it more participatory without discarding all its fundamentals" (ibid: 10).

### Participation: from political science to development management

Participation is not only a term that relates to political science, but also a hotly contested term in development discourse in many respects. "It is increasingly recognized that the term encapsulates a wide range of approaches from methodological tools to political philosophies" (Cornwall 2001, Gaventa 2001, Gaventa and Valderrama 1999 in McGee et al. 2003: 11). The term 'participation' has been increasingly used to refer to a large range of social and political interactions (McGee et al. 2003: 11).

Molutsi (2002: 50) argues: "Strengthening democratic institutions and fostering a participatory approach to governance are seen by many development practitioners as important tools to promote social and economic development and to enable a country to manage emerging global, national and local issues. In this context, the importance of promoting dialogue and partnerships between government, the private sector and civil society is gaining growing consensus."

The political development in recent decades shows that democracy is the best form of government and that has been almost universally accepted. Many governments in developing countries have crafted and adopted some of the world's best constitutions. The growing challenge now, however, is how to translate the constitutional provisions into institutional and legal frameworks. More importantly, the growing challenge is to translate public declarations into democratic culture and practice (Molutsi 2002: 50). However, Austin (1994: 4 in Molutsi 2002: 54) arguing from different front says: "the danger, therefore, is to expect too much of what might be called political or constitutional engineering since, in reality, the success of democratic institutions has been organic not mechanical." McGee et al. (2003: 7) argues that most opportunities for citizen participation in local governance arise in the contexts of democratic decentralisation. In this context, decentralisation is a strong political strategy to translate the public declarations into reality.


### Participation in non-institutionalized democracies

As discussed above almost all writers who advocate citizen participation present the notion of concept in a noble form; however, it is not that simple, in practice particularly in a young democracy. Citizen participation in practice is determined by many critical factors associated directly with power. Therefore, true participation does not take place easily in reality as presented above in an idealistic manner. The following key aspects influence the level of participation.

1. A political system that allows democratic practices and existence of democratic institutions closer to people is critical factors for sharing of power and effective participation. Decentralisation of power, which most likely be absorbed by intermediate level of government or by powerful stakeholders while trickling down to the grassroots level.

2. Historical factors, social norms and values, level of consciousness of democratic rights are very influential in participation. Socio-economic conditions also matter for effective participation because they imply unequal power relations that directly impede the capacity to engage in public life. Heller and Chaudhari (2002: 2) caution: "Any theory of participation in non-institutionalized democracies must as such explicitly take into account unequal social relations and uneven institutional environments as a cost of participation."

Democracy is a long-term affair. "Democracy grew up historically out of a century-long struggle among social groups and between state authorities and their subjects" (Skocpol 1999: 14 in Heller and Chaudhari 2002: 4). Participation in democracy is a process of shifting the balance of power from the centre to closer to the citizen. Planning and development at local level are key governance activities that take place in political, social, and economic contexts and demand involving a wider range of stakeholders and influencing social as well as political power relations. Effective participatory process is possible only when power is shared at different levels and among different stakeholders. In this context, effective decentralisation, as a strategy of sharing power at different levels and stakeholders, plays an important role in broadening citizen's participation in political, economic and social realms at the local level. It offers diverse opportunities to participate in governance practices in addition to the formal electoral process.
