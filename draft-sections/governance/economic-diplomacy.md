## Economic diplomacy

The concept of economic prosperity emerged during the 18th century which is known as classical free trade doctrine propounded by Adam Smith and the comparative cost theory of David Ricardo. However, this notion has been widely used only after the 1970s as the process of liberalization; privatization and globalization proliferated in the global and regional regime of international trade. Europe had pursued a traditional mechanism of protectionism and Margaret Thatcher in 1970s came up with the new doctrine of liberalization and privatization. As Thatcherism gained momentum, many countries of the world have been using the channels of diplomacy not only for political purpose but also for economic advancements. The term 'economic diplomacy' is of recent origin. In the early days, the term trade diplomacy was used to denote a narrow sense of trade and commercial relations between nation-states. The notion of trade diplomacy became popular with the nationalization of industries in many countries across the world from 1950's to 1970's. As a result, the gradual involvement of diplomatic representatives for the promotion of trade and business increased and these nation-states were interested in creating new markets for the products of their home country abroad.

After the end of the Second World War, the discourse of international relations was undergoing an era of transition, paradigm shift and new economic balance. State owned economies could not yield tangible results for the economic growth of the countries. Consequently, countries started adopting the policies of liberating their economies from the restrictions of the government and felt the need of foreign aid and investment to ensure their economic sustainability. To accomplish this task, the mobilization of diplomatic missions for convincing the foreign investors and shifting the focus of foreign policy apparatus for policy dialogue and lobbying pertaining to the issue of economic diplomacy came at the forefront. In this global trend, Nepal was no exception. Nepalese economy suffers from structural inherent constraints comprising land- locked-ness, rugged topography, poor resource base, high extent of poverty, and sluggish economic reforms. The major challenge to Nepalese economy is to integrate the domestic economy with regional and global economies and maximize the benefits of globalization. However, a vast potential for robust growth with poverty reduction through efficiently utilizing available domestic and international capital, technology, natural resources and entrepreneurship to make a breakthrough in the economic front still exists. Moreover, Nepal's strategic location, amidst two neighbouring economic giants like India and China, provides a tremendous scope for generating spill over effects on Nepalese economy. Also Nepal., being the headquarter of SAARC, could mobilize regional co-operation by attracting foreign direct investment to create a win-win effects in mutually beneficial areas especially natural resources and biodiversity, regional trade, tourism, education and health-sectors wherein the edge of comparative and competitive edges do exist. Against this backdrop, "economic diplomacy" is being considered as a vital component of Nepal's foreign policy particularly after the 1990s.

2. Conceptualizing Economic Diplomacy

Economic diplomacy refers to the formulation and advancement of policies pertaining to production, movement, exchange of goods, services, labour and investment in other countries. It is profoundly interested in exploring the issues of economic policies. It is that form of diplomacy which employs resources, either as reward or punishment in pursuit of a particular foreign policy objective. Besides foreign trade, it includes external investments, financial flows, aid, bilateral and multilateral economic negotiations and technological exchanges.

It engages in contacts with foreign and sending states' institutions, businesses and international organizations to advocate the sending state's economic interests; seeks to resolve bilateral trade disputes and negotiate with trading partners to liberalize world trade. A distinct feature of economic diplomacy is that, private sectors are involved in the decision making process to influence negotiating position and to remain in the global or regional competitive market. This is because market developments are rigorously monitored by private sectors and they know where and how to invest and sell goods and services in the interests of a country.

Rana (2007) defines economic diplomacy as "the process through which a country tackles the outside world to maximize their national gain in all field of activities including trade, investment and other forms of economically beneficial exchanges where they enjoy competitive advantages'. It has bilateral, regional and multilateral dimensions, each of which is important.

According to him, economic diplomacy is the use of political influence and relationships to:

- Promote international trade and investments, improve the functioning of markets
- Reduce the costs and risks of cross-border transactions
- Secure private property rights
- Develop international telecommunications, energy and transport sectors
- Consolidate right policy climate to facilitate and institutionalize all these objectives.

3. Significance of Economic Diplomacy in the era of Liberalization, Privatization and Globalization (LPG)

Economic globalization has increasingly made economic diplomacy a prominent factor in foreign policy. Economic progress and prosperity depend on beneficial relationship with other countries and each country wants to penetrate into other countries with its goods, services, labour and investment. Economic diplomacy predicts the outcomes of future trade regimes and therefore it needs an understanding of market factors at work in a given global economic environment.

Furthermore, there is an awareness that economic diplomacy may strive for greater transparency, better information and greater clarity. The vitality of economic diplomacy should also be assessed in terms of the changing foreign aid scenario after the end of the Cold War leading to competition for such aid among countries that had once belonged to the Soviet Blocs. The grant element in the aid package has given place to concessionary finance or loans payable within a liberal time frame with sufficient grace period. In brief, the time for grants-in-aid has passed and LDCs like Nepal strive to receive loans from international financial institutions like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank in concessionary terms.

Trade not aid, is the prevailing motto in economic relations among nations today. It is undoubtedly a more powerful catalyst of sustainable development than aid. As Nepal has obtained the membership of WTO which calls for increased capacity-building to compete with other trading partners in the world market, Nepal must adopt a prudent and coherent export policy and mobilize its diplomatic mission towards attaining the export objectives. Investment or, for that matter, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is a crucial factor for development, as it brings capital, technology and marketing skills. Diplomatic missions should be provided the updated and bankable investment projects so that they can approach prospective investors in the countries of their assignment. It is possible to attract FDI in such areas as hydropower, tourism, biodiversity and education where Nepal has both comparative advantage and competitive edge.

4. Nepalese Context

The evolution of Nepal's economic diplomacy had its origin even before the advent of democracy in 1951, though the approach was quite piecemeal, haphazard that lacked systematic approach. During the 18th and 19th century, Nepal simply pursued an active trade policy but didn't give priorities to the establishments of relations with other countries of the international community. This situation changed after 1950s, marked by the desire of Nepal to strengthen its bilateral and multilateral ties. The open door policy of Nepal also pushed forward the concept of foreign aid and loans. However, the concept of economic diplomacy was not broad and encompassing in those days as it is today.

In fact, economic diplomacy today has become a new and critical component of Nepal's foreign policy, and the country has been justifiably striving, in recent years, to promote it as effectively as possible. The incorporation of economic elements into foreign policy and diplomatic activities has tremendously increased to accomplish the objective of poverty eradication which is one of the most crucial agenda under the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in contemporary international relations. The efficient conduct of economic diplomacy depends to a large extent, on the deployment of trained manpower and expertise in all diplomatic missions. These missions should be provided with adequate resources to undertake promotional activities. In the day-to-day schedule of the mission, priority needs to be accorded to the task of promoting and strengthening economic ties with the countries to which missions are assigned. It is important to remember that successful diplomacy seeks to bridge differences and widens common ground to realize or achieve shared interests. (United Nations Development Report, 2006) Nepal's current comparative advantage in international trade lies in its resource-intensive and labour-intensive product areas. More than 95% of manufactured exports are concentrated in these categories (Nepal Trade and Competitiveness study, 2004). Nepal has already shown clear price-margin advantage in at least eleven export products within her areas of comparative advantage (Pyakuryal, 2004). Since Nepal is a bona fide member of WTO, SAFTA and BIMSTEC, amendments have been made compatible with globalization and liberalization in the acts and regulations pertaining to these priority areas. The membership of WTO has offered lucrative prospects of increased market access which enhances the effectiveness and efficiency of our trading capacity ultimately leading to the higher level of economic growth and improving the quality of the life of people. Among others, Nepal has made a conditional commitment to open up sectors like legal service, engineering, architecture, advertising, market research and restaurants for attracting unprecedented FDI. With accession to the WTO, Nepal will now have to hone its technical and financial capabilities to increase competitiveness and to be able to gain from the rulebased trading regime.

Nepal has immense potentials for economic development through mobilizing the prime foundations of Nepalese economy which are as follows:

Water Resources and Hydropower

Bilateral, regional and international co-operation to initiate mega projects for hydropower development in Nepal is a great opportunity. Investment in hydropower is safe and secure, with investment-friendly climate supplemented by appropriate laws, regulations and credit facilities. Moreover, funding arrangement is being explored; detailed design works are underway for the infrastructure and access road to encourage foreign investors to launch hydropower projects in Nepal. Proper harnessing of water resources and developing hydropower will ensure both sustainable high growth and substantial poverty reduction.

Tourism

Tourists coming to Nepal can enjoy their holiday trips with full assurance of tranquillity, security, high quality services and facilities as per with the international standard at a cheaper rate. Nepal is often combined by the long haul consumer with holiday destinations from India and Tibet. The possibility of international partnerships in marketing the Himalayan region is at present being explored and the ideal partnership would include Tibet, as Nepal is often its gateway, and both destinations are combined by tour operations. A study commissioned by ADB on South Asian sub-regional co-operation has identified opportunities to jointly promote eco-tourism and Buddhist circuits in Bangladesh, Bhutan, north and north-east India and Nepal. By 2020 India will be supplying almost half a million visitors to Nepal, while UK, Japan, France , North America and Australia will emerge as high value markets which will be providing one thirds of the total visitors to Nepal (TRAPAP NEP 99/013).

Biodiversity

The bio-geographical position of Nepal is very apt for the fact that Nepal may claim the wealth of two very large and diverse realms of the world i.e., the Palaeo- arctic in the northern region and the oriental in the southern region. Its location in the central sector of the Himalaya has further enhanced its bioclimatic diversity due to the fact that the more humid condition of the eastern Himalayas and the drier western Himalayas interpenetrate into Nepal. Nepal's proximity to the tropics, and its topographical and altitudinal range from deep valleys to mountain crests, create condition for the occurrence of tropical to arctic climates. There are some specific products that can capture the local market and can be linked to the markets outside of the country. These are beekeeping and honey production, ginger, winter and summer vegetables, milk and milk products, poultry and meat products and sub-tropical fruits.

4.1 Major Exportable Products with Comparative and Competitive Advantages 

Nepal has developed its comparative and competitive advantages over several products, which are exported to a number of destinations comprising Asia, Europe, Africa, North and South America. These products are:

Pashmina products

"Pashmina", a Nepalese word for the highest quality of wool (generally 11-14 micron, long sample fibre), is an ultra fine and exceedingly softwood or diamond fibre extracted from the body of the mountain goat "Chyangra". The incredible softness of pashmina combined with unique and superior products has increased the demand for it worldwide. The main export products made from pashmina are shawls, stoles, mufflers, scarves, blankets and readymade garments which are woven on a wrap of cotton. Reaping the benefits from the selling of pashmina products is a bright prospect for Nepal.

Leather and leather products

For the last few decades, Nepal has been producing and exporting a wide variety of leather goods, both of modern and traditional designs in different sizes and colours such as fashion shoes and boots, jackets, trousers, travel bags, camera bags, wallets, belts, gloves, aprons etc. USA, Japan, Pakistan, Italy, Brazil, UK are the major export markets for Nepalese leather and leather products.

Nepalese Paper and Paper Products

Nepalese paper made from 'Lokta' has its own unique features, which has tearing strength. Lokta papers withstand insects and temperature extremes with exceptionally durable and resistant quality. During olden days, Lokta paper was primarily used for making calendar, kites, woodblock printers, masks, stationery gift wrappers, bags, greeting cards, lampshades and printing materials for books and other publications.

Handicrafts

Handicrafts are an important sector to provide employment to the vast segment of craftsmen and generate substantial amount of foreign exchange in the country. Over the years, export of handicrafts has grown significantly and also has been diversified to 150 countries. The major handicraft products include: metal statues, ethnic costumes, traditional silver and gold jewelleries, ceramic products, stone sculptures, metal utensils, floor coverings among others.

4.2 Institutional and Procedural Constraints of Economic Diplomacy

Despite the fact that there are ample opportunities present in Nepal to advance its economic interests through the tactful diplomacy, it has not been able to materialize them properly. Some critical problems have stood as obstacles in this regard:
- Poor homework in the direction of export promotion and investment promotion (including standards of quality control)
- Labour problems in attracting FDI
- Lack of co-ordination in policy and implementation of it
- Handling of appointments, transfers and promotions of the foreign ministry officials on the basis of political patronage leading to the mockery of administrative norms
- Paucity of funds and the status of donor-receiver relationship between the finance and foreign ministries.
- Role of foreign ministry not being proactive due to poor inter-agency co-ordination
- Lacklustre private sector role
- No appointment of right person on the basis of KAP (Knowledge, Aptitude and Practice) but on the basis of nepotism and favouritism
- Weak linkages between the government and the academic think-tanks and lack of effective tie-ups between academic institutions and business organizations

4.3 Strategies to Promote Economic Diplomacy

Economic diplomacy is not a periodic plan or programme. It is a part of the integrated foreign policy of Nepal. At this juncture, it is crucial to understand that economic diplomacy cannot succeed only with the effort of the government. The business community must be proactive if they are to get mutually benefited from the advancement of economic diplomacy. The private sector must come up with innovative policies and enhance their competitiveness, so that the overall economy of the country can be directed towards the path of sustainable progress and prosperity. Various factors are to be taken into consideration to foster Nepal's economic diplomacy.

A. Missions

The role of Nepalese mission abroad is to communicate properly with the host government that Nepal as a developing country with meagre financial, economic and infrastructural base needs foreign aid and investment for the expansion of social capital in the country. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should provide adequate trainings and development programmes to the employees of the missions so that they can improve their negotiating skills and tackle other problems that might occur in the due course of pursuing economic diplomacy.

B. Effective coordination between embassies and consular offices

All Nepalese embassies and consular offices should have a list of errand in Nepal, link with hotels or agencies so as to develop their contacts with Nepalese agency. In order to disseminate adequate information about Nepal's rich cultural and natural diversity, various programmes such as seminars, exhibitions, and talk- shows among others need to be conducted in the premises of Nepalese missions abroad.

C. Focus countries

It is very important to identify the potential countries for the promotion of our products. For instance, the prospective markets for our primary products are USA, Germany, UK, Japan and India. Holland, Spain, Italy and Australia are in the second list. This will help in concentrating our efforts for boosting up export trade and achieving the targets of economic diplomacy in a sustainable manner.

D. Honorary Consuls

The selection of honorary consuls must be based upon meritorious criteria such as educational qualification, professional experiences etc. They should be trained to improve their innovative skills and knowledge base. Apolitical personalities with proven track records should be entrusted with the task of advancing the economic priorities of the country.

E. Country Specific and Product Specific Programmes

Nepal should categorize the countries and cities on the basis of strategy for foreign employment and cities for exporting goods. A clear idea about the potential markets should be in our mind and we should be able to cater to the unique needs of different countries. Without a proper assessment of this issue, our diplomatic effort to improve the country's economy is likely to suffer from a huge setback.

F. Strengthening the Institute of Foreign Affairs (IFA)

IFA should be empowered by ensuring the meaningful representations of ex-ambassadors and diplomats in this institution which will assist in the knowledge and experience sharing in the field of diplomacy including economic and political diplomacy. The role of IFA should be more focused on conducting extensive research, preparing term papers and initiating policy dialogues rather than merely providing orientation trainings to the members of Foreign Service who are going to serve in the mission abroad.

5. Conclusion

Collaborative commitment and devotion to overcome the challenges of economic diplomacy is the need of the hour. In the same way, identification of potential countries on priority basis is equally urgent for further promotion of private investments, employment opportunities, export trade and official developmental assistance. To make the foreign office more creative and efficient, MOFA may initiate reconstruction of the whole apparatus so that it will be well-equipped to grapple the challenges and eventualities that lie ahead in the successful conduct of our economic diplomacy. Moreover, it is imperative to focus on hydropower potentials, handicrafts, and herbal products to earn more foreign currency for the country. And finally MOFA should make effective co-ordination between the line ministries, apex business organization like FNCCI, CNI and also take the NGOs/ INGOs in confidence, which are working for the socio-economic transformation of our society.
