## Lawmaking process

Bills can be either "government" bills, which are introduced by the government, or "private" or "ordinance" bills, introduced by a member of parliament. The constitution stipulates that bills dealing with finances or money or with security agencies must be government bills, and such bills reuqire five days advance notice to the Secretary General of the Parliament Secretariat. Private bills require at least seven days advance notice. In practice, majority of bills in Nepal have been government bills. According to the parliament secretariat, the legislature has approved 453 government bill and three private bills. The three bills were the Human Rights Bill, Nepal Health Professional Council Bill and Legal Aid Bill. In all, 62 private bills have been introduced since 1991.

### Finance bills

There are different types of finance bills, including appropriation bills, vote on account bills, supplementary appropriation bills, and vote of credit bills. Any amendment to a finance bill can be proposed through a censure motion, which is carefully deliberated and decided in the parliament. 

A bill for legislation that formulates or executes a new policy is called an original or independent bill. A bill that amends an existing act is called an amendment bill. A bill that codifies or consolidates different provisions of similar nature in existing laws is called a codification bill.

The President may enact an "ordinance" on the recommendation of the Cabinet when the parliament is not in session. The ordinance has the same force and effect as an "act," but it must be approved by parliament in its next session, or it ceases to be in effect. The President can also repeal ordinances at any time. An ordinance, unless repealed or rendered ineffective earlier, ceases to be in effect 60 days after commencement of the next session of parliament. In the event an ordinance is passed onto the next session, an "ordinance substitution bill" is offered. Lawmaking must begin again with a new bill if the ordinance is rejected by parliament.

### The Legislative Process

Preliminaries: A member intending to introduce a bill is first required to state its objectives and rationale to the Parliament Secretariat. Bills that involve finances must be accompanied by an estimate of the cost. Bills that require delegated legislation or subordinate legislation for execution must be accompanied by a memorandum stating the reasons for having delegated or subordinate legislation and the nature and limitations of such legislation. Concerned departments draft government bills; individual members may seek assistance from the Parliament Secretariat in drafting bills.

Introduction

A member seeking to introduce a bill, and any member who opposes the introduction, are allowed by the Speaker to make brief statements. The Speaker then offers a motion to introduce the bill. The legislative process begins if the parliament votes yes. Copies of the bill are made available to members two days before the motion to introduce the bill.

Second reading: A member introducing a bill proposes either that it be considered immediately, or that it be circulated for public comment. Whichever option the member proposes, any other member may propose the other option. The Parliament then discusses the objectives and rationale of the proposed bill, after which it is held for 72 hours to allow time for members to suggest amendments. If the option for public comment is adopted, the bill is published in the Nepal Gazette, specifying a period for public comment in accordance with the procedure determined by the Speaker. At the end of the comment period, the member in charge of the bill may move that the bill and the public comments be considered. When this general discussion concludes, the member may propose that the bill be discussed clause-by-clause by the parliament, or that it be referred to the Legislative Committee. Other members may propose amendments to the bill at this stage.

Debate (clause by clause): Normally, bills are referred to the Legislative Committee for a clause-by-clause discussion. After discussion, the committee submits its report to parliament. The member in charge of the bill may then propose either that the bill and the report be considered by the parliament as a whole, or that the bill be sent back to the Legislative Committee for reconsideration. The member can also withdraw the bill at this stage. According to Rule 77, the member in charge may move to withdraw the bill, and other members may oppose the withdrawal. After both sides are allowed to clarify their positions, the Speaker calls for a vote. If the parliament votes for withdrawal, the bill is considered withdrawn.

Third Reading: After the bill has been discussed clause-by-clause, either in parliament or in the Legislative Committee, and the final committee report with amendments has been submitted, the member in charge moves for passage of the bill. The Speaker offers a motion for a decision, and if the parliament passess it by majority vote, the vote is certified by the speaker and forwarded to the president. (No bill rejected by parliament can become law). The bill becomes law after authentication by the president.

The time needed for a bill to become law basically depends on the size and nature of the bill, and the issues involved. The experience of the Parliament Secretariat indicates that at least three weeks is needed to satisfy the rules and manage the process of passing a bill. Sometimes, however, lack of understanding among stakeholders or girdlock between opposing parties can unpredictably prolong the process. Legislation relatin gto the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and the Bill on Disappearances, has taken on exceptionally long time to pass.

With the approval of parliament, the Speaker may "fast track" a bill by suspending the rules. This approach has been used frequently since 2008, particularly for passing constitutional amendments extending the tenure of the CA. Parliamentary Rule 157 allows this suspension.

Financial Procedure

All taxes collected by the government must be authorized by law. Similarly, the government may not obtain loans or offer guarantees unless expressly approved by law. The constitution establishes a Consolidated Fund where all revenues received by the government, all loans obtained on the security of revenues, all monies received in loan repayment and other monies received by the government must be credited (one exception is revenues of religious endowments or Guthis).

Expenditures may be made from the Consolidated Fund or any other government fund (a) for money charged to the Consolidated Fund, (b) to meet expenditures under the Appropriation Act, (c) as advance money authorized by an act to meet expenditures when an appropriation bill is under consideration, or (d) expenditures to be incurred in extraordinary circumstances under a vote of credit act, which contains only a description of expenditures but no line items.

The Finance Minister presents an annual economic survey after the parliament approves the government's policies and programs. This document provides an overview of economic performance of the past fiscal year (usually based on data for eight months). The Finance Minister also proposes estimated revenues and expenditures - the budget - for the new fiscal year. The estimates must be accompanied by expenditure statements for the preceding year from each ministry, and assessments of whether those expenditures achieved their objectives. The Finance Minister also introduces an appropriation bill - legislation to implement the budget - and, depending on the requirements, may introduce a vote on account bill, a bill to raise domestic loan, an economic bill, or a bill relating to loans and securities.

In circumstances where it is not possible to submit the budget for the next fiscal year by the end of the current year, the government can collect revenues in accordance with the Finance Act of the year just ended. In such situations, the Finance Minister may present a bill seeking authority to spend in the next fiscal year an amount not exceeding a third of the total expenditure of the current fiscal year. The amount spent in such a manner is included in the appropriation bill. In extraordinary situations - such as 2002/03 and 2005/06, when Nepal had no parliament - finance ministers have made statements of income and expenditures through the media. This was, however, an exception to parliamentary norms.

In principle, public money cannot be spent in excess of the amount authorized by the Appropriation Act. The Finance Minister can propose a supplementary estimate for the fiscal year if the approved amount for a particular category is inadequate, for new services that were not planned but need funds, or if the expenditures made in a particular year were in excess of the authorized amount. In such cases, the amount needed under specific categories is included in the bill.

The Finance Minister presents the Vote on Account Bill to ask parliament for a portion of the estimated expenditure for the upcoming fiscal year in advance, pending passage of the appropriation bill. But the proposal cannot be submitted until the budget is presented in parliament, and the sum requested cannot exceed one-third of that budget. The expenditures incurred under the Vote on Account Act are eventually included in the appropriation bill. This arrangement is justified because budget discussions normally go beyond the end of the fiscal year, and funds are required for public expenditure while the budget is still under consideration.

The government can request a vote of credit from the parliament to cover emergency spending due to natural disasters, threats of external aggression, internal disturbances or other exigencies for which it is not possible, practical or expedient to provide normal budget estimates and justifications. The Finance Minister may submit a Vote of Credit Bill to parliament containing only a statement of expenditures.

To meet unforeseen expenses, the government can create a Contingency Fund though an act of parliament. The monies appropriated by the act are deposited in the fund, which is controlled by the government. These monies must be reimbursed as soon as possible.

Note

The term 'money bill' refers to bills concerning any or all of the following: 

- The imposition, collection, abolition, remission, alteration or regulation of taxes

- The preservation of the Consolidated Fund or any other Government Fund, the deposit of monies into, and appropriation or the withdrawal of monies from such funds, or the reduction, increment or cancellation of appropriations, or of proposed expenditures from such funds;

- The regulation of matters relating to the borrowing of money or guarantees by the government, or any matter pertaining to the amendment of law with respect to any financial obligations undertaken or to be undertaken by the government;

- The custody and investment of all revenues received by any Government Fund, monies acquired through the repayment of loans, and grant monies; or audits of the accounts of the Government of Nepal.

(A bill is not not be deemed to be a money bill by the reason only that it provides for the levying of any charges and fees such as license fee, application fee, renewal fee or for the imposition of fines or penalty of imprisonment or for the levying of any taxes, charges or fees by any local authority. The decision of the Speaker of the Legislature-Parliament is final in the case of a dispute.)

### Other parliamentary function

The parliament is entrusted with certain key functions, including the authority to amend or repeal any article of the constitution by a two-thirds majority of members present. The process of amending the constitution is similar to that of passing a bill, with a slight variation: instead of the Legislative Committee, the Speaker may, with approval of parliament, form a special committee for a clause-by-clause discussion of proposed amendments.

The parliament also conducts hearings on the appointment of ambassadors and appointments to the Supreme Court and the constitutional bodies, and it can consider motions to impeach appointees. These motions need a two-thirds majority to pass.

Parliament may control and review executive and administrative functions through questions, and by discussing motions such as a "proposal of urgent public importance", a "motion to call attention" and, if needed, a vote of no confidence against the Prime Minister. An extraordinary procedure called an adjournment motion may also be used to consider matters of urgent public importance.

Committee reports are discussed in parliament, and the minister concerned is required to respond to members' questions. This mechanism is intended, among other things, to
assure accountability.

### The parliament secretariat

The Secretariat of the Legislature-Parliament, or the Parliament Secretariat, provides administrative, managerial, and logistical support to the parliament and its committees. It also provides services to offices of political parties in parliament. The Secretariat is headed by a Secretary General appointed by the President at the recommendation of the Speaker. The Secretary, also appointed by the President, assists the Secretary General. The Secretariat has eight divisions - legislative, personnel administration, international coordination, information and research, member support, human resource development, and law and security.

The Speaker chairs the Secretariat's Operation and Management Committee
(SOMC), the highest policymaking body. The Deputy Speaker, the Secretary General and two secretaries are members. (Two positions, Secretary General and Secretary of the Legislature-Parliament, are created by the Interim Constitution, Article 61a, and the Secretary of the Secretariat is created by the Legislature-Parliament Secretariat Act). The SOMC formulates policies for the operation and management of the Secretariat, and supervises its functions.

Grants from the government and aid from donors are the Secretariat's sources of finance. All foreign assistance received must be reflected in the government's annual budget. The Secretariat must get auditing approval from the MOF and the Auditor General before signing agreements to receive foreign assistance. Rule 4 of the Financial Procedures Rules of the Secretariat mandates that all foreign grants be reflected in its budget. The Secretariat has never complied with this provision, a point repeatedly raised by the Auditor General and by members of parliament.

### Public accounts and state affairs committees

The main function of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) is to oversee public accounts and review the Auditor General's report. This entails investigating arrears in audit reports, directing concerned agencies and individuals to take corrective actions, and following up.

Between 2006 and 2011, the PAC met 135 times - roughly 500 hours - to review irregularities discovered in audit reports. Much of 2006 was spent on the backlog of audit reports and the irregularities from 2000 to 2005. Its report in 2006 noted that irregularities were frequent, and that due attention was not paid to settling advances on time, and it decried the widespread tendency to flout the law. The report instructed government agencies to correct the irregularities. However, four years later, in its 16th report, the PAC found that irregularities remained a major challenge, and had reached Rs. 90 billion.

By and large, PAC directives have yet to be fully implemented. There was some progress after it issued orders in February 2009 instructing the government to take action against employees who failed to settle accounts on time, but the PAC does not have a way to supervise the implementation of its directives, and this has affected compliance.

Besides reviewing audit reports, the PAC investigates suspected irregularities. One recent example involved the procurement of machine-readable passports. The PAC stepped in after the government scrapped the procurement process and awarded the contract to an Indian company. The investigation found fault with the decision, and instructed the government to make amends. After the Supreme Court also found fault with the decision, the government reversed itself and hired another supplier after cancelling the earlier procurement process.

The State Affairs Committee looks into the functioning of the OPMCM, the ministries of defense, home affairs, and general administration, and constitutional bodies such as the CIAA, the PSC and the National Election Commission, and issues directives as needed. (For details see http://www.can.gov.np/np/ committees/view/42.) Its report in 2011 recommended that the government finalize the Rashtriya Mool Niti (a broad policy defining national interest,) and a policy on security, and also directed the government to make appointments to vacant positions in constitutional bodies. However, its recommendations have largely gone unimplemented. One recommendation that was acted on by the CIAA involved irregularities in procuring armored personnel vehicles for Nepali peacekeepers in Sudan.
