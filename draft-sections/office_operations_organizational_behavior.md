## Inventory management: Introduction and importance

Inventory is a quantity or store of goods that is held for some purpose or use (the term may also be used as a verb, meaning to take inventory or to count all goods held in inventory). Inventory may be kept "in-house," meaning on the premises or nearby for immediate use; or it may be held in a distant warehouse or distribution center for future use. With the exception of firms utilizing just-in- time methods, the term "inventory" typically implies a stored quantity of goods that exceeds what is needed for the firm to function at the current time (e.g., within the next few hours). Inventory may includes raw materials, finished goods, work in progress and daily consuming goods.

Inventory is physical goods in store bought for the purpose of the major business activities which hasn't been sent to the workplace. In the case of bank, draft, cheque, ledger, voucher templates and stationary equipments can be taken as inventory.

Inventory is held in organization for three motives. They are:

- Transaction motive -- to facilitate smooth operation. This also means retail/business must have products stocked in order to meet the demands of customer.
- Precautionary motive -- to guard against unpredictable changes. Usually, in manufacturing, runing out of only one item can prevent a manufacturer from completing the production of its finished goods.
- Speculative motive -- to take advantage of price fluctuations

Why inventory leves should not be kept high ?

- Requires large capital investment
- Space usage
- Obsolescence
- Complicates inventory contol system

Why inventory levels should not be kept low ?

- Inventory deficit
- Inefficient usage of human and capital resources

### Inventory management

Inventory mangement is the management to keep the optimum (not less, not more) level of inventory for the smooth operation of an organization. Broadly, inventory management, or inventory control, is an attempt to balance inventory needs and requirements with the need to minimize costs resulting from obtaining and holding inventory. There are several schools of thought that view inventory and its function differently.

Effective inventory management is all about knowing what is on hand, where it is in use, and how much finished product results. As well as scheduling the inflow and outflow of stocks in the inventory efficiently, assessing cost effectiveness of managing an inventory should factor in three types of costs that constitute total inventory costs: Holding costs (also called carrying costs, that result form maintaining the inventory), set-up costs and purchasing costs.

### Importance of inventory management

- To achieve the organization goal by reducing investment
- To protect make productive use of assets
- To reflect all the records of inventory
- To establish inventory discipline by minimizing the risk of theft, misuse or inventory
- To formulate inventory related policies
- To purchase, use and manage the assets at low cost
- To prepare a base for inventory inspection
- To stop purchasing unwanted goods
- To minimize the risk of stock out and over stock
- To keep the inventory level at a reasonable level

## Organizational norms and moral systems

Norms are acceptable standards of behavior within a group that are shared by the members of the organization. Norms define the boundaries of acceptable and unacceptable behavior. They are typically created in order to facilitate group survival, make behavior more predictable, avoid embarrassing situations, and express the values of the group. 

Each organization will establish its own set of norms that might determine anything from the appropriate dress to how many comments to make in a meeting. Organizations may exert pressure on members to force them to conform to the group's standards. The norms often reflect the level of commitment, motivation, and performance of the organization.

Performance norms determine how quickly members should work and how much they should accomplish. They are created in an effort to determine levels of individual effort. They can be very frustrating to managers because they are not always in line with the organization's goals. Members of a group may have the skill and ability to perform at higher levels but they donâ€™t because of the organization's performance norms. For example, workers may stop working a production machine at twenty minutes before quitting time to wash up, even though they produced fewer items that day than management intended.

Reward-allocation norms determine how rewards are bestowed upon organization's members. For example, the norm of equality dictates equal treatment of all members. Every member shares equally so rewards are distributed equally to everyone. Equity norms suggest that rewards are distributed according to the member's contribution. Members may contribute through effort, skill, or ability.

Social responsibility norms reward on the basis of need. Members who have special needs therefore receive the largest share of the reward.

## Record management

Records are the information created, received and maintained as evidence and as an asset by an organization or person, in pursuit of legal obligations or in the transaction of business ( -- definition of ISO 30300 standard). Records refer to archival information and data in all forms created or received by public institutions in relation to the affairs thereof such as:

- Document, books, ledgers, cards, drawings, 
- Audiovisual material and
- Electronic documents

and, 

- Documentary art records.

Records may be available in different formats;

1. Eye readable: Paper, microfilm
2. Machine readable: Electronic records, email, digital image, audio visual
3. Other: Physical objects (artifacts)

Public records management allows to realize transparent and responsbile administration of public institutions as well as safely keep and efficiently utilize public records and, by ensuring public rights to claim of information, henceforth foster effective participation of citizens in governance. Likewise, recent e-government initatives produces many e-document and records. All of these information should be archived and preserved for the reason of legal, historical and cultural evidence. But the latter also requires different technologies, methods and practices.

Effective record management is an essential precondition for:

1. Good governance
2. The rule of law
3. Administrative transparency
4. The preservation of mankind's collective memory, and
5. Ensuring the citizen's right to information

Characteristics of authoritative records (as mentioned in ISO 30300) are:

1. Authenticity: An authentic record is one that can be proven to be what it purports to be.
2. Reliability: A reliable record is one whose contents can be trusted as a full and accurate representation of the transactions, activities or facts to which they attest, and
3. Integrity: A record that has integrity is one that is complete and unaltered
4. Usability: An useable record is one that can be located, retrieved, presented and interpreted whithin a time period deemed reasonable by stakeholders.

Some of the features of a record that make it distinct from non-record are:

- Was it created in the course of business ? Correspondence, studies
- Was it received for action ? Controlled correspondence, departmental information request
- Does it document activities and actions ? Calendars, meeting minutes, trip reports
- Does it support financial obligations or legal claims ? Funded award files (contracts or grant files)
- Does it communicate requirements ? Policies or procedures
- Are you or your unit responsible for keeping it ?
- Does it provide information regarding the historical development of government programs or people ?
- Is it required by an approved records disposition schedule ?
- Is it generated and used in agency business, but is owned by the agency ?
- Is it a reference material; reports written by other agencies, journals and newsletters ?
- Is it a convenience copy ? Duplicate copies of correspondence, policies, reports
- Is it a stock copy of a publication ?
- Is it a draft or a working paper ?

Records have lifecycle. From birth to death but, different from humans, or to permanent life. Its stages can be summarized into following major heads:

1. Creation
- Generation
- Receipt
- Capture
- Register

2. Use
- Distribution
- Use
- Access

3. Retention
- Classification
- Indexing
- Storage

4. Disposition
- Evaluation at the end of retention period
- Transfer
- Destroy
- Legal hold

5. Long term preservation
- Arrangement
- Description
- Preservation
- Migration

6. Destruction (alternative to long term preservation)
- Complete destruction
- Shred
- Degaussing

## Communication

It can be said with truth that nothing can be done without communication: orders, instructions, information, requests all have to be commu-nicated in order that action may be taken on them. Communication is a vital service that the office provides to the organisation. The efficiency with which this function is carried out has a very great bearing on the efficiency of the organisation as a whole and on its continued success.

It is necessary, therefore, to examine the factors that create an effective communication system in an organization. The communication requirements of a large provincial government authority differ radically from those of a small local level public office. Nevertheless, there is a great deal of common ground and we can therefore examine the general factors necessary for effective communication to exist whatever the circumstances. They may be defined as follows:

1. Language: The recipient of a communication must be able to understand the words used, especially if technical jargon is employed. It must also be recognised that different levels in the organisation may use different language and even think differently. An appropriate example is the use of accountancy terminology by top management to explain to workers on the shop floor why their pay cannot be increased.

2. Timing: A badly timed communication will receive less than the full attention it deserves; this includes both time by the clock and time by opportunity. A telephone call will not normally be welcome at 4 o'clock in the morning: neither will a communication be fully considered if the other party is just off to catch a flight for which he or she is already late.

3. The medium: This must be appropriate to the purpose and the circumstances. For instance, it would not be appropriate to discuss procedures of good procurement which require paperwork and pro-forma submissions over the telephone.

4. Attitude: There must be trust and mutual respect between the parties to a communication for it to achieve full and unbiased understanding. Mistrust, acrimony or prejudice between them can result in unintentional or deliberate misunderstanding.

5. Willingness to participate: Both parties must be willing to communicate or effective understanding will not flow. Often unwillingness comes about because of unfortunate attitudes that have become established in the mind of one party or the other because of past experience or because of the influence of prejudiced colleagues.

Over the past two or three decades there has been a change in workers' attitudes to their employers. In present management/worker relations there has been a move away from the old notion that management could dictate to staff and workers and expect unquestioning obedience to the idea that the cooperation of the workforce must be sought by persuasion.

Managers, including the office administrator, have an important duty to communicate clearly with their subordinates in such a manner that these workers can understand the facts being conveyed and be able to interpret them within the context of their normal working environment. There is also a duty on managers to instruct their subordinates both to carry out their everyday duties and to instruct them in new skills. How the latter is done is of extreme importance as future work efficiency will depend upon the excellence of the communication between the parties.

Vertical communication

This is the line of communication down and up the organization structure. In the past vertical communication was almost wholly downward. The top level administrative authority made the decisions and these were passed down through the various levels of management and supervision to whatever level had to implement them. This was the traditional authoritarian approach to communication within an organization.

However, modern governance system embracing standards of good governance and efficient public administration demand more than a mere giving and blind acceptance of instructions and orders. Employees at all levels are now aware of the effects that management decisions may have. The modern concept of two-way vertical communication has, therefore, developed. Not only must an organisation now provide a channel for the downward flow of communication, it must also make formal provision for a flow upwards from the shop floor to the higher levels of management.

Nevertheless, it remains true that the main vertical flow is downwards because this is the way that instructions and directives have to be given. However, suggestions, comments and objectives are now part of the accepted upwards flow.

Vertical communication can be susceptible to failure and it is important that there is an adequate system for conveying instructions, directives, information, suggestions and grievances between management at all levels and the workforce, ensuring that communications reach those they are intended to reach.

Horizontal communication

In order that the day-to-day business of an organisation may proceed smoothly there must be effective and unimpeded communication across departments between persons at about the same level of authority. Thus, the a finance officer may have to communicate with the administrative officer or with departmental technical officer. This form of communication is termed 'horizontal communication' and is a very important part of an organisation's communication system. Without it the day-to-day business of the concern could not carry on and if it is inefficient the running of the organisation is impaired.

A great of success in horizontal communication depends upon the attitudes prevailing between departments/section and particularly between departmental heads. There must be an atmosphere of complete cooperation throughout the organisation. If even only one department is uncooperative it can have a very real influence on the effectiveness of horizontal communication and on the functional procedures which depend on efficient communication.

## Correspondence (Notetaking, proposal, memoranda and report writing)

### Memoranda

Memoranda are written communications intended for internal use only. The first question to ask about a memorandum ('memo' is the popular name) is: 'Is it really necessary to write one at all?' In very many cases the answer will be 'No' because the matter could very well be dealt with over the internal telephone. All too often the memo is looked upon as a defensive device to be used in the future to avoid blame - and an expensive defence it is to the organisation. A memorandum should be used only where the absolute accuracy of the written word is essential. 

A memorandum should be brief and to the point. Brevity, however, does not mean discourtesy and the same care in quality and politeness should be taken as when a letter is composed. The matter to be dealt with should be presented in a direct fashion. Ambiguity should be avoided and the same precision in the use of words is required as in the more formal letter. A memorandum should also deal with only one subject.

In general memoranda are typed, but they need not be. In fact, it can be said to be quicker and less costly if they are handwritten by the originator. This removes the need to call and dictate to a typist who has then to transcribe and type the memorandum, which then has to be returned for signature. If the originator is provided with a pad and carbon paper it is quick and easy for the message to be written by ballpoint pen and certainly less costly than having it typed. 


### Report

According to the dictionary a report is 'an account or opinion formally expressed, after investigation or consideration'. It will be seen from this definition that a report is considered to be formal and is required to give an account of the matter covered or to state an opinion on it.

There are two main kinds of report, though not every report will fall neatly into one or other of these categories. The first is the individual report. This is usually expressed in the first person and is the kind used for internal routine reports and short reports on day-to-day matters. Examples of these are accident reports, organisation and method reports, sales reports and so on. In some cases, particularly where a great deal of statistical and other figure information is included, a standard form is used so that variable data only has to be entered in the same way as in a standard form letter.

The second type of report is the general report. This is more formal than the individual report and is generally written in the third person, though this is not always the case. Such reports are frequently composed for external or public circulation and are often quite voluminous. Official reports of this nature sometimes run into two or more volumes bound in book form, with extensive indexes.

### Basic rules of report writing

There are basic rules that underly all forms of report writing, which do two things. First they ensure the logical construction of the report and second they assist the writer to present the report in an accepted format. These rules may be summarised as follows:

1. Should have a title
2. If addressed to a specif person or a specific body of people, should begin with salutation.
3. Any but a very brief informal report should begin with a statement ofvthe terms of reference.
4. An introduction to the body of the report is usual.
5. The body of the report should explain the nature of any investigations carried out, facts discovered and should put clearly and succintly the arguments and opinions, arising from the investigations.
6. Long reports should be broken down into sections with headings to guide reader.
7. The conclusions are normally required.
8. Report should be signed and dated.
9. Whenever the report is of a meeting, the names of those present should be given at the head.
10. Frequently parts of a report will be supported by graphs, tables of statistics and other similar data. It is usually recommended that such matter form an appendix or appendices.
11. A lengthy report should always to be accompanied by a table of contents.
