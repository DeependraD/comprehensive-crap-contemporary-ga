## Multidimensional povery index

The MPI was created for the 20th anniversary edition of the human development report published by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). MPI utilizes different factors to evaluate poverty beyond income (UNDP 2010). Initially, this MPI was developed by the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) at Oxford University. The MPI assesses the nature and intensity of poverty at the individual level, with poor people being those who are multiplily deprived and the extent of their poverty being measured by the extent of deprivations (Alkire, and Santos 2010). MPI displays deprivations in education, health and living standard. The indicators of MPI under the education, health and living standard are as follows:

A. Education (each indicator is weighed equally at 1/6)

(1) Years of Schooling: (deprived if no household member has completed five years of schooling)
(2) Child Enrolment: (deprived if any school-aged child is not attending school in years 1 to 8) 

B. Health (each indicator is weighed equally at 1/6)

(3) Child Mortality: (deprived if any child has died in the family)
(4) Nutrition: (deprived if any adult or child for whom there is nutritional information is malnourished)

C. Standard of Living (each indicator is weighed equally at 1/18)

(5) Electricity: (deprived if the household has no electricity)

(6) Drinking water: (deprived if the household does not have access to clean drinking water or clean water is more than 30 minutes walk from home)

(7) Sanitation: (deprived if they do not have an improved toilet or if their toilet is shared)

(8) Flooring: (deprived if the household has dirt, sand or dung floor)

(9) Cooking Fuel: (deprived if they cook with wood, charcoal or dung)

(10) Assets: (deprived if the household does not own more than one of: radio, TV, telephone, bike, or motorbike, and do not own a car) (Alkire, and Santos 2010)

The MPI reveals the combination of deprivations. A household is identified as multidimensional poor if and only if it is deprived in some combination of indicators whose weighed sum exceeds 30% of all deprivations. This deprivation on corresponding indicator is measured by either 0% or 100%. If there is full deprivation, score of that indicator is 100% and if there is no deprivation, score of that indicator is 0%.
