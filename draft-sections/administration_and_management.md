## Group dynamics

A group can be defined as several individuals who come together to accomplish a particular task or goal. Group dynamics refers to the attitudinal and behavioral characteristics of a group. Group dynamics concerns how groups form, their structure and process, and how they function.

Group dynamics are relevant in both formal and informal groups of all types. In an organizational setting, groups are a very common organizational entity.

### Group formation and development

There are several theories as to why groups develop. A classic theory, developed by George Homans, suggests that groups develop based on activities, interactions, and sentiments. Basically, the theory means that when individuals share common activities, they will have more interaction and will develop attitudes (positive or negative) toward each other. The major element in this theory is the interaction of the individuals involved.

Some of the other theories explaining why group formation occurs are:

- Social exchange theory (individuals form relationships based on the implicit expectation of mutually beneficial exchanges based on trust and felt obligation)
- Social identity theory (individual get a sense of identity and self-esteem based on their membership in salient groups)

The most com mon framework for examining the "how" of group formation was developed by Bruce Tuckman in the 1960s. In essence, the steps of group formation imply that groups do not usually perform at maximum effectiveness when they are first established. They encounter several stages of development as they strive to become productive and effective. According to Tuckman's theory, there are 5 stages of group development:

1. Forming
2. Storming
3. Norming
4. Performing
5. Adjourning

### Group types

Groups may be classifed based on whether they are formal or informal in nature. Formal work groups are established by an organization to achieve organizational goals. Formal groups may take the form of command groups, task groups, and functional groups.

In contrast to formal groups, informal groups are formed naturally and in response to the common interests and shared values of individuals. They are created for purposes other than the accomplishment of organizational goals and do not have a specified time frame. Informal groups can take the form of interest groups, friendship groups, or reference groups.

### Group structure

It refers to a pattern of relationships among members that hold the group together and help it achieve assigned goals. Structure can be described in a variety of ways. Among the more common considerations are group size, group roles, group norms, and group cohesiveness.

## Leadership, decision making, encouragement and motivation

### Motivation

An organization is an entity of human and non-human resources joined together to achieve a predetermined objective or objectives. 

In reality individual and organizational objectives are often at odds. Man, the psychologists say, is a wanting animal. AH Maslow has defined a hierarchy of needs to be:

1. Physiological needs -- hunger, thirst, etc.
2. Security, shelter, warmth
3. To belong
5. Self-expression
6. Self-fulfilment

Once the major needs of security and hunger, etc. have been satisfied, it is likely that organizations which follow purely mechanical systems, ignoring personal objectives, will find receding morale in employees. Thus scientific management relies primarily on the instrumental rewards strategy to motivate employees. Pay bonuses are distributed to workers who meet or exceed performance standards. Taylor believed pay is important to workers because it is instrumental in helping them achieve their personal goals, goals that lie primarily outside of the workplace.

Frederick Herzberg has devised "motivational" and "hygiene" factors. The former type include:

1. Achievement
2. Recognition
3. Advancement
4. Work self
5. Possibility of growth
6. Responsibility

This short synopsis of behavioral theory indicates only that there is a growing body of opinion which suggest that all the old ideas about motivation, based on financial incentives, need to be critically examined.

## Management: introduction, concept, objective, scope and function

Gulick identified seven management functions using the acronym POSDCORB:

- Planning
- Organizing
- Staffing
- Directing
- Coordinating
