## Financial crime control and property whitewash regulation

The financial crime has expressed itself as new criminal scheme in the developing globe. Generally, all crimina activities conducted with an attempt to financial enrichment is included under financial crime. There have been variations in the kinds, behavior, extent and the degree of sophistication involved in financial crimes in recent days. Likewise, every country has experienced ever increasing form of these crimes in recent times. With the widespread connectivity and globalization, financial crimes too are rising in intensity in Nepal.

Foreign employment, fiscal, banking, property and assets, stock, foreign exchange, tax, revenue and customs are some of the concerning sectors 


### Money without a trail

People from every sphere of the sociopolitical spectrum seem to have a hand in it: from politicians and government officials to prominent industrialists and small scale operators-all have significant involvement in one of the most widespread financial crimes that is money laundering. And of course, there are the more recognised criminals: drug traffickers, human traffickers, terrorists and the likes thereof.

In 2020 itself, two prominent money laundering scams did the rounds on the media. First, the curious case of PK Haldar, whose ingenious laundering of Tk 10,200 crore to countries such as Canada and Singapore would tempt any film scriptwriter and second, the criminal activities of a lawmaker, who along with his lawmaker wife and relatives, was not only involved in money laundering, but also in the more sinister crime of human trafficking.

According to media reports, between 2016 and 2020, Tk 355 crore was transacted from around 500 bank accounts of the independent lawmaker for Laksmipur 2 Mohammad Shahid Islam Papul and his associates. Papul's wife, reserved-seat independent lawmaker Selina Islam, their daughter and close relatives were all allegedly involved in this. They made their fortunes through human trafficking.

These figures seem incredible, but they are only two of the many money laundering incidents that have taken place this year. In fact, it took the authorities years to even detect them. From the more all-pervasive "hundi" to the more sophisticated trade-based mechanisms, capital flight takes place every day and in many forms. While most are deprived of their fair share of media exposure, some, such as PK Haldar or MP Papul, do get their 15 minutes of fame.

A Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) report from earlier this year suggested that around USD 3.1 billion (Tk 26,400 crore) is laundered out of the country every year. A 2018 IMF study reported that underground economic activities in Bangladesh accounts for about 30 percent of its GDP. Most of the black money invariably, and understandably, fly abroad.

In the Basel Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Index 2020, Bangladesh fell to 38th position from 45th in 2019 among 141 countries. This means the country is more vulnerable to the crime of capital flight. And trade based capital flight remains a major headache for Bangladesh. According to the Global Financial Integrity report ranking, Bangladesh is one of the top countries facing trade-based money laundering (TBML).

Given the stats, one might easily wonder why the regulators are not able to rein in the situation. "This is the failure of the government agencies responsible for combating money laundering. However, it is difficult to tell from the outside if this is due to their incapability or involvement in capital flight. The cases of PK Halder or Shahid Islam (Papul) are just the tip of the iceberg," suggested prominent banker, economist and former deputy governor of Bangladesh Bank Khondkar Ibrahim Khaled.

BFIU was formed as part of compliance with recommendation 29 of the Financial Action Task Force, that says, "Countries should establish a financial intelligence unit (FIU) that serves as a national centre for the receipt and analysis of: (a) suspicious transaction reports; and (b) other information relevant to money laundering, associated predicate offences and terrorist financing, and for the dissemination of the results of that analysis. The FIU should be able to obtain additional information from reporting entities, and should have access on a timely basis to the financial, administrative and law enforcement information that it requires to undertake its functions properly."

Under the Money Laundering Prevention Act, there are 27 categories of financial crimes. Based on the nature of the crimes, BFIU sends intelligence reports to different relevant agencies. For instance, if the crime is related to corruption and bribery, the report is sent to the Anti-Corruption Commission. For forgery and related crimes, intel goes to the Criminal Investigation Department; for trade based money laundering, including over-invoicing, under-invoicing, tax evasion and related financial crimes, information is shared with the National Board of Revenue. For financial crimes related to drugs, the Narcotics Control Department is alerted. In case of financial crimes related to stock exchanges, intel is shared with the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission "for further investigation and taking it to prosecution", added Abu Hena Mohd Razee Hassan.

## Money laundering 

The himalayan times

The issue of money laundering in Nepal has activated the role of the Department of Money Laundering Investigation - a government entity responsible for fighting money laundering and terrorist financing (AML/CFT) plus other forms of illegal earnings.

Money laundering is akin to laundering clothes. Money laundering is an attempt, or activity, to clean the dirty money to legitimise its illicit sources. While laundering clothes is good for health, laundering money is detrimental for the economy, progress and prosperity of a country.

To put it simply, money laundering is an endeavour, or the process, of converting the proceeds from criminal activities into legitimate income. The major sources of laundered funds are bribery and corruption, economic scam, trafficking, drugs dealing, tax evasion, smuggling, organised crimes and credit card frauds.

Money is laundered in three steps. First, placement. The proceeds of a crime are first brought into the financial
system. Second, layering. Multiple transactions, accounts, banks, intermediaries and countries are used to disguise the origin of the funds. Third, integration. Laundered funds are brought back in the system as legitimate funds.

There are five important techniques involved in the process of money laundering. One is through the use of shell companies, like "jhole companies" with no physical office with the real offices lying in the carrying bag. Another technique is exploiting weak spots in financial institutions. This happens when there is weak supervision of legal structures. Money is also laundered by means of smuggling of physical cash. Likewise, trade-based money laundering (TBML) is also a technique used to clean the money of illicit source through mis-invoicing. Also in vogue is the technique of mixing clean and dirty money in cash intensive business.

The nature and magnitude of money laundering depend on multiple factors: physiological condition, geography, technological advancements and new global trends. Money laundering goes beyond the borders. So it is treated as a transnational crime with global networks. A recent study confirms that the size of money laundering in the world is estimated at about 2-5 per cent of global gross domestic production. Nepal is vulnerable to money laundering because of our weak legal compliance, poor governance system and impunity.

### Money laundering

Published: January 25, 2018 2:40 am On: Opinion

Money laundering is a serious threat to any country's financial system. The loss of financial and moral integrity is a given but the magnitude of its damage extends to a larger dimension in the form of loss of sovereignty, and, to an extent, the degradation of a country's image. Money launderers tend to seek out countries or sectors in which there is a low risk of detection due to weak or ineffective Anti-Money Laundering programmes, putting countries like Nepal in a vulnerable position.

Money laundering is the process of illegally converting black or dirty money into "white" or legal money. Dirty money does not have legal sources.

Instead, it comes from illegal activities such as drug trafficking, terrorism, organised crime, murder or fraud. Money launderers make such money appear clean by processing it through several legal transactions though multiple financial institutions. In other words, they cover up illegal sources through legal processes.

Money laundering is generally carried out in three steps: placement, layering and integration. First, the illegal wealth is deposited in shell companies, banks or casinos.

The second stage concentrates on separating the proceeds from criminal activity through the use of various layers of monetary transactions, say layering. Then, finally, the laundered money is brought back into the mainstream financial system by paying taxes to legitimise wages, thus giving the money a "legal" source. Across the world, a huge amount of money obtained through terrorist financing, drug and human trafficking is laundered annually.

In 1996, The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) stated that the aggregate amount of laundered money in the world could be somewhere between 2-5 percent of the world's GDP.

Since the very first stage of money laundering, placement, occurs at banks and financial institutions, it is vital for such institutions to be extra vigilant while performing financial transactions.

It is especially so in Nepal as our financial system is still predominantly ruled by cash-based transactions or transactions emanating from non-account holders.

Money laundering can have a huge negative impact not only on a country's economic and financial stability but also on political development in developing countries.

### Making the super-rich pay their fair share

The hindu Transparency seems to have become taboo in India. As the country remains mired in an economic slowdown, with evidence of falling employment and consumption, the government is persistent in its denial. Instead of actually addressing the problem, it seeks to suppress or manipulate official data to somehow provide a more optimistic picture. We saw this once again recently as the Union Budget was presented, based on numbers for revised estimates for the current year and Budget estimates for the coming year that the Finance Ministry itself knows are unlikely.

The opacity of data also extends to cross-border movement of funds generated through a range of activities, including tax evasion, misappropriation of state assets, laundering of the proceeds of crime, and bribery. Even here, India still has a lot to do, as confirmed by the recent publication of the Financial Secrecy Index by the Tax Justice Network, a U.K.-based financial advocacy group. On the surface, India has managed to reduce its contribution to global financial secrecy, with its rank falling from 32 on the 2018 index to 47 in 2020, but this is partly because the new edition of the index covers more countries than it did two years ago.

Arrangement with Switzerland
It is true that the government has adopted and supported a few transparency reforms, such as the automatic exchange of tax and financial information with other jurisdictions, like Switzerland. Thanks to that, for example, if an Indian citizen has an account with a Swiss bank, and has a balance over a certain threshold, this information will be sent to the Indian tax authorities automatically.

But stopping the financial haemorrhage and making multinationals and the super-rich pay their fair share of taxes requires much more. Capital flight out of India by Indian elites and foreigners alike has been undermining our country's development for decades. An important part of these flows is the result of artificial profit shifting by multinational companies taking advantage of an outdated international tax system.


These multinationals may be making profits in India but can easily declare those profits in a low tax jurisdiction like Hong Kong and justify that transaction as a payment for the use of a patent. According to one estimate, this strategy represented a loss of \$27.5 billion in 2014 for the Indian government, up from $142 million in 2000.

The government did create a beneficial ownership register - which would allow the identification of the beneficial owner of an asset regardless of whose name the title of the property is in - but the law is weak, since it exempts a lot of people at the discretion of the authorities. Also, this register is not accessible to the public.

Onshore financial services
That's not all. Three years ago, the government took the paradoxical decision to set up onshore international financial services in the country. This is how the International Financial Services Centre in the Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT-City), Gandhinagar, emerged, modelled after offshore financial centres such as Hong Kong, Singapore, the City of London and Dubai. While this has not created much employment, it has led to growing possibilities for regulatory arbitrage by financial firms, with potentially very problematic consequences.

Meanwhile, the government keeps granting tax incentives on a discretionary basis, even though there is little evidence that these incentives attract investment. Instead, as shown recently in International Monetary Fund research, factors such as quality of infrastructure, a healthy and skilled workforce, market access and political stability matter much more. The massive reduction in corporate tax rates has thus far not led to any increase in private investment - but it has meant a significant reduction in tax revenues, with devastating consequences. It translates into a lack of resources for education, healthcare, food and nutrition and infrastructure. India is already an outlier among similarly placed developing countries with its low tax-GDP ratio of 18%. The government budget is also highly dependent on indirect taxes like the Goods and Services Tax which are regressive and hit ordinary citizens harder.

Increasing public spending
It is now beyond obvious that India cannot revive its economy without increasing public spending, and so increasing its fiscal resources is essential. Among other measures, this requires urgent adoption of legislation and institutional reforms to end financial opacity - including, for example, opening the beneficial ownership register to the public and stopping the creation of onshore tax havens.

In addition, the Government of India must also assume a more vocal role in the international debate about how to make multinationals pay their fair share of taxes. This means continuing to appeal for a United Nations tax body, which is much more legitimate than the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the arena where tomorrow's global tax system is being decided. The OECD's proposals, published at the end of 2019, are neither ambitious nor fair enough, as the Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation (of which I am a member) explained in a recent report. If the organisation continues to remain deaf to the demands of developing countries, India must be prepared to go it alone, thinking unilaterally about how to make multinationals pay what they owe.

### Financial crime on the rise in Nepal

Published at : May 9, 2018
Updated at : May 9, 2018 09:22Kathmandu

Nearly 180 financial crimes worth Rs36 billion have been registered in Nepal in the last eight years. National Banking Institute (NBI) published the statistic on Monday and highlighted the need for developing a robust mechanism to counter such challenges in the wake of digitalization.

In a day-long conference held in the Capital in association with India's Fintelekt, the NBI said that financial crime has become a big challenge not only for Nepal but for the entire global banking industry. Sanjib Subba, CEO of NBI, said there was a need to develop robust mechanisms to counter the growth of financial crimes.

"With the advent of digitization, there could be modes of financial crimes which the industry has not discovered or experienced. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to be prepared for all types of financial crimes."

Priyanka Kadam, director of regulation at First Data, shared information about the types of financial crimes in remittance business and the best ways to counter them.

Similarly another expert from India, Prasun Singh, chief of Internal Vigilance, HDFC Bank, highlighted advanced techniques for fraud detection in the banking industry.

Narayan P Paudel, executive director, Regulation Department of Nepal Rastra Bank, shared two aspects of banking fraud that can be observed-weak level of corporate governance and threats caused through technological advancements.

Sashin Joshi, former banker, emphasized on four major aspects for occurrence of fraud namely breakdown of the system, coalition, negligence and lack of due diligence and the most important, lack of knowledge.

DIG Pushkar Karki shared that the chance of fraud has been heightened due to the sheer number of transactions. He suggested that both the bank and CIB should work towards creating a secure financial environment.

The programme was attended by over 100 senior level bank employees from across the nation.

### 122 Chinese suspected of cyber, financial crime held

Published: December 24, 2019 7:15 am On: Kathmandu

Kathmandu, December 23

Nepal Police today arrested 122 Chinese nationals, who entered Nepal on tourist and student visas, on suspicion of their involvement in illicit activities, such as cyber and financial crime.

They were arrested from seven private residences in Kathmandu - three in Manamaiju and two each in Bansbari and Budhanilkantha - between 1:00pm and 7:00pm. Police have confiscated a large number of laptops and mobile phones from these apartments.

"We believe they were involved in illegal activities, including cyber and financial crime," said Central Investigation Bureau Deputy Inspector General Neeraj Bahadur Shahi. "We will soon reveal what exactly they were doing in rented apartments."

The operation was conducted by the Central Investigation Bureau of Nepal Police in coordination with Metropolitan Crime Division-Teku, Metropolitan Police Range-Teku, Metropolitan Police Office-Rani Pokhari and the Police Headquarters. It is not known whether these Chinese nationals had valid visas to stay in Nepal or were overstaying.
 
These Chinese nationals were living secluded lives in rented apartments, which looked like offices, according to DIG Shahi. "They possessed special identity cards and anyone who wanted to enter those apartments had to produce the IDs," said Shahi. "This was very strange which raised our eyebrows," he added.

Most of the arrested Chinese had visited Nepal on tourist visas. "But they were not engaged in touristic activities. Anyone who enters Nepal on tourist visa should stay here like a tourist," said Senior Superintendent of Police Uttam Raj Subedi, who heads Metropolitan Police Range-Teku. Some of those arrested had arrived in Nepal on student visas.

The police arrested them after clandestinely monitoring their activities of the last few days.

Police rounded up the Chinese nationals using "urgent arrest warrants". This type of arrest warrant allows police to detain suspects for up to 24 hours. Within these 24 hours, police will have to present them at the Kathmandu District Court, which will decide whether to free them or detain them for a few more days for further investigation.

Police have kept the arrested Chinese at police stations across Kathmandu district.

These arrests were made almost four months after six Chinese nationals were arrested in connection with the country's biggest cyber heist in the banking sector, which saw illegal withdrawal of at least Rs 35.8 million from ATMs in Nepal and India.

### Cross-border crimes

In what appears to be one of the biggest raids, Nepal Police arrested as many as 122 Chinese nationals from various parts of the capital on Monday on suspicion of their involvement in illegal activities, cyber and financial crimes. Tipped off by the Chinese Embassy in Kathmandu, they were rounded up from Manamaiju, Bansbari and Budhanilkantha areas between 1:00 pm and 7:00 pm. Police have also seized around 500 laptops and more than 150 mobile phones from their rented apartments. Police believe they were indulging in illegal activities, such as cyber and financial crimes. "Urgent arrest warrants" were issued by the Central Investigation Bureau of the Nepal Police in coordination with the Metropolitan Crime Division-Teku, Metropolitan Police Range-Ranipokhari and the police headquarters. Earlier, the Chinese Embassy had written a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the entry of those Chinese people from the Philippines, Cambodia, Malaysia and Sri Lanka. The Foreign Ministry had immediately forwarded the letter to the Home Ministry, which instructed the police headquarters to take action. They are learnt to have fled the said countries after the governments started cracking down on them for indulging in hacking the banking systems there and in China. Preliminary investigation shows that all of the arrested had entered Nepal on a tourist or student visa.

The Kathmandu District Court will now decide whether to free or detain them for a few more days. Such a large number of Chinese nationals have been detained in a single day four months after six Chinese nationals were arrested in connection with the country's biggest cyber heist in the banking sector, from where they had stolen at least Rs 35.8 million from the ATMs in Nepal and India. The police are yet to establish whether the new arrests have any connection with the old ones. The way they had rented the apartments at very high prices and used special identity cards to enter there shows they had bigger plans to commit cyber, financial crimes and engage in other illegal activities.

In recent times, Nepal has become a lucrative place to engage in cyber and financial crimes for international racketeers, who are taking advantage of the country's security lapses. Despite Nepal Rasta Bank's repeated notifications to the banks and financial institutions to upgrade their security system, they have not adhered to the instructions. Strong vigilance, especially at major tourist hubs, is a must to control cyber crimes, smuggling and drug trafficking. The law enforcement agency must make sure that no foreigner on a tourist or a student visa is involved in non-tourist activities. Others who overstay their visa should be booked and legal action taken against them. We also need to further strengthen mutual cooperation with our friendly countries when it comes to dealing with criminal activities. Their arrest would not have been possible without cooperation from China. At a press briefing in Beijing on Tuesday, a Chinese foreign ministry official confirmed the arrest of the Chinese nationals in Nepal. The official also confirmed that the action was taken under mutual cooperation between the two countries.

Inhumane behaviour

There was a time when buffaloes were made to trek hundreds of miles from the Tarai plains to the Kathmandu Valley before being slaughtered for meat. They no longer walk, but the conditions under which they are transported in trucks from one place to another are simply harsh. The Supreme Court, following its verdict on February 11 on a writ petition demanding the government prohibit people from transporting domesticated animals and birds in an inhumane and cruel manner, had directed the government to enact the Animal Welfare Act. However, animals continue to be transported for more than eight hours without food in crammed trucks, with the government remaining a mute spectator.

It must be difficult for the government to implement the legal provision on animals, knowing fully well how even humans must fare in our overcrowded public vehicles. The inhumane way of transporting animals is only half the story, the savagery with which they are slaughtered deserves even greater attention. If we are to live in a civilised world, we must look after the welfare of not only humans but also that of animals. The sooner the government acts, the sooner it will help ease the pangs of the animals.

### Zero tolerance against financial crime: NRB

Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) Governor Yubaraj Khatiwada said on Monday that the central bank had adopted a zero tolerance policy against financial crime.
Misdeeds in the financial sector have swelled in recent years along with an increase in the number of financial institutions. Several companies have become crisis-ridden as a result of the transgressions of their operators, many of whom have landed in jail for embezzling public deposits.   

Governor Khatiwada said that the regulatory body was working on reforms in the financial sector to ensure that it runs efficiently and in a transparent manner.

The central bank has recently taken measures requiring banks and financial institutions (BFIs) to provide greater disclosure. It is also planning to introduce a new NRB Act enabling it to liquidate crisis-ridden BFIs and revamp the Bank and Financial Institution Act to give greater power to the central bank.

Speaking at a programme organised by the Nepal Rastra Bank Employees' Association to mark its silver jubilee, Khatiwada said NRB had been facing lots of challenges in the process of reforming the financial sector.

"However, NRB has adopted the policy of maintaining a solid footing in the present situation. A time will come when it will have to look forward and not remain in its present position," he said.

Lauding the role of the trade union in improving NRB, the governor stressed the need to strengthen the central bank too. "Unless the regulator keeps itself upgraded with the changing times, the functioning of the entire financial sector cannot be improved."

Meanwhile, a majority of the speakers at the programme criticised the uneven pattern of the loan portfolios maintained by BFIs with most of them limiting their lending in urban areas. Due to this trend, most people in rural areas are still deprived of the opportunity of benefiting from financial services, they said.

Similarly, CPN-UML Chairman Jhala Nath Khanal said the role of fiscal, financial and monetary policies were vital during social transitions like the present one in order to maintain stability. "NRB now needs to focus on improving the economic indicators of the rural economy," he added.  

Leaders of the employees' union stressed the need to develop a financial inclusion modality to give access to the poor in the financial system. "Needy people have been compelled to pay high interest rates for loans, and such a situation should end," they said.

### goAML to check financial crime

As per the direction by Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), all commercial banks have adopted the goAML software since Magh 1, 2076 B.S. NRB sought to have the commercial banks install the software last year itself but at the time the banks were not ready and therefor sought some more time. NRB is also planning to get the software installed by development banks, finance companies and other financial and non-financial institutions from Asar 1, 2077 B.S.

Information exchange
The goAML (Anti-Money-Laundering System) software was developed by the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC) as per Nepal's commitment to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) regarding automating the financial information unit (FIU) in 2010. The FIU, the financial intelligence unit of Nepal, was established in 2008 B.S. under the Assets (Money) Laundering Prevention Act, 2008. The FIU issues directions to banks and financial institutions regarding reporting on financial transactions so as to detect money laundering and terrorism financing activities, if any. The banks and financial institutions are required to ensure compliance with reporting requirements, failing which they will be fined. The FIU inspects the transactions and records of the banks and financial institutions. The FIU also coordinates the holding of training and awareness programmes. Further, the FIU develops an information exchange mechanism with other FIUs or allied international institutions by signing an MoU with them or through membership.
The goAML software has been adopted by the UNODC to strengthen capacity to tackle financial crime like money laundering and terrorism financing. The UNODC is hopeful that the software will help member states across the world to enhance their capacity for detecting and dealing with such financial crime in a more effective way. The software has been designed in such a way as to meet the IT requirements of FIUs of various member states irrespective of the size and volume of data to be handled. As the majority of FIUs are unable to develop the IT capacity required for data collection, processing, analysis and management, the UNODC has come forward to develop the software.
The goAML software serves as a standard and uniform AML bridgehead for banks and financial institutions to deal with money laundering and terrorism financing in a more vigorous way. It is a comprehensive IT tool; it integrates fourteen separate functions- from data collection to intelligent report writing- into one package. So it is cost-effective vis-à-vis the approach to developing one-off site-based IT solutions. Instead of using several different IT solutions, this integrated system can be used more effectively.
With the installation of the goAML software, commercial banks will have to have compatible systems in place, which need to be linked to the FIU. The banks will also have to change their internal system and upgrade their core banking system to make them compatible with the software. Now the details of all transactions of a bank will go to the software through its core banking system. The installation of this software has been necessitated by the need for banks and financial institutions to go digital to cater to the financial needs and demands of customers in a prompt and effective manner. Now, commercial banks can send reports on threshold transactions and suspicious transactions to the FIU digitally, thus obviating the need for manual submission.
One of the salient features of the goAML software is to enable banks and financial institutions to capture all transactions of a particular customer even if such transactions are made in various branches and at different times. In Nepal, a deposit of over Rs. one million has to be reported to the FIU. So some unscrupulous people or organisations may resort to smurfing so as to hide their huge deposits. Now such smurfing cannot be resorted to in commercial banks.
Banks and financial institutions have KYC details of their customers. However, such details may be lacking in the case of old accounts. In some cases, such details may be fragmentary. Now, commercial banks will have to completely update the KYC details of every depositor in that every detail will have to be fed into the goAML software. What is more, even data not sought by the FIU and other unnecessary data will have to be entered into the software. This may be taken as a hassle.
The procedures for depositing money to accounts have also changed with the installation of the goAML software. In addition to a conductor's (deposit-maker) name, signature and contact number, other details may need to be disclosed like three generation details. However, only those details that have not been submitted to a bank yet need to be disclosed. The deposit-maker may also be asked about the sources of the funds to be deposited to a particular account. Further, a third party depositing an amount of over Rs. 100,000 to an account needs to submit a copy of his/her ID to the bank. So it will consume more time than in the past while depositing money in a commercial bank.

Mandatory adoption

NRB intends that all banks and financial institutions and even non-financial institutions use the goAML software as part of the policy on anti-money laundering and combating financing of terrorism. Any entity supposed to implement the software may be fined from Rs. one million to Rs. 50 million for failing to implement the software. It may be hoped that the software will contribute greatly to making the AML regime stronger and more robust, thus discouraging financial crime like money laundering and terrorism financing. And banks and financial institutions should take the mandatory adoption of the software on a positive note rather than as a burden.

### Dirty money flow and fragile democracy

Namrata Sharma

According to BBC report of 21st September 2020, HSBC's share price fell to its lowest level since 1995 amid allegations of money laundering. On Monday in Hong Kong, the shares fell by more than 4 per cent and in London at midday they were down 6 per cent. Shares in rival banks such as Standard Chartered and Barclays were down by 5 per cent and 6 per cent, respectively, while that of Germany's Deutsche Bank went down 8 per cent.

Unhealthy economy

The lack of a healthy financial system anywhere leads to an unhealthy democracy. It will not be an exaggeration to say that these banks and similar financial institutions operating worldwide are helping in creating an unhealthy global economy by taking dirty money which could be the proceeds of crimes like drug dealing or corruption and getting it into an account of a "respected bank" where it will not be linked with crime. Banks need to make sure they don't help their clients to launder money.

On 20th September at 11pm Nepal standard time and corresponding time all around the world, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) revealed the FinCEN Files. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is a government body that monitors financial transactions system in the US.

FinCEN Files reveal financial transactions from 1999 to 2017. The files include 2,100 extremely secret documents known as the Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) that were obtained by BuzzFeed News and shared with ICIJ. It was then collaborated with journalists in ICIJ's network around the world. Their partner in Nepal is the Centre for Investigative Journalist (CIJ) Nepal.

Amy Wilson-Chapman, ICIJ Community Engagement Editor, mentioned in their release, that they will be continuously releasing a series of "shocking worldwide tour of corruption and inequality". Although the idea of money laundering and the despots, terrorists and drug lords who benefit from it may not register as an immediate threat- especially in a year punctuated by a global health crisis, the coronavirus pandemic may actually show how important every dollar is to our revenue-starved governments.

These documents gave the ICIJ team insights into the secret world of international banking. From these files more than 400 reporters in 88 countries have taken "threads of information" including names of companies and people and researched further on them, interviewed and further sourced about 17,000 additional documents to tell stories of notorious figures who have benefitted from a system that has been unable to protect the general people.

The FinCEN Files name big global banks, including JP Morgan, HSBC, Standard Chartered Bank, Deutsche Bank and Bank of New York Mellon. This report shows how very simple citizens like a man in California were killed because he was part of a Ponzi scheme. Another example is the Russian parents who wanted a used car to take their sick child to hospital but instead ended up losing US$ 15000; cases of Olympic athletes being cheated of victories by crooked officials and drug dealers who lure innocent people into overdose for which the funds travel across the global financial systems which many of us never realise.

Banks like JP Morgan may have helped a man known as the Russian mafia to move more than a \$ 1billion through the financial system. The husband of a woman who has donated Pound 1.7m to the UK's governing Conservative Party was secretly funded by a Russian oligarch with close ties to President Vladimir Putin. The UK is compared to Cyprus by the intelligence division of FinCEN. The number of UK registered companies that appear in the SARs are over 3,000. The Standard Chartered Bank moved cash for Arab Bank for more than a decade after clients' accounts at the Jordanian Bank had been used in funding terrorism.

FinCEN files exposure could portray Nepal as a country with a weak legal system and lack of trustworthy economy, says Shiva Gaunle, Editor CIJ, Nepal. As partner of ICIJ in Nepal, CIJ explored the FinCEN files and has exposed that between December 2006 and March 2017, nine banks, 10 companies and various individuals in Nepal were found to have transacted suspicious funds in the name of cross-border trade. These Nepali business entities are linked to the international smuggling of gold, antiquities, bitumen, and telecommunication equipment. Standard Chartered Bank, Prime Commercial Bank, Bank of Kathmandu, Nepal Investment Bank, Everest Bank, Mega Bank, Himalayan Bank, Apex Development Bank of Kaski, and Nepal Bangladesh Bank are on the list of banks involved in transferring suspicious money. The FinCEN files show the involvement of 10 Nepali companies in directly sending or receiving the suspicious funds.

Suspicious transfer

An amount of US \$ 292.7 million has been transacted through these banks and companies during the period of 11 years. The total sum of incoming and outgoing amounts turns out to be \$177.6 million. Out of this amount, \$103 million has made a clear exit from Nepal. Likewise, \$74.6 million has arrived in Nepal. As per the FinCEN files, Standard Chartered Bank of Nepal has brought and sent the largest sum of money in regard to suspicious transactions and transfers.
Investigative reports like these have revealed the corruption and dirty money flow several times creating a sensation. It indicates that there lacks proper will and system globally to check the rich and powerful from using the very system to guard the money. This probably leads to fragile democracy and human rights surfacing globally.

### Opt for discreet ways

The government on Sunday swung into action by raiding three medical colleges for money laundering investigation, an act that could, however, send a wrong message to potential investors. The Department of Money Laundering Investigation raided Nobel Medical College, Biratnagar, National Medical College, Birgunj, and Chitwan Medical College, Chitwan, based on a report of the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology and National Vigilance Centre. Nepal's medical colleges have been in the news for quite some time, with students picketing the colleges every now and then, seeking refund of the extra fees collected from them. The government has repeatedly asked the medical colleges to return the extra money taken from the students, and only last week, Education Minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel had warned that a fraud case would be filed against those medical colleges failing to do so within a fortnight. The medical colleges have, however, ignored the government's warning and refused to abide by the government rules. It is common knowledge that medical colleges have investments or the blessings of bigwigs in the major political parties, and this is one of the reasons that emboldens them when dealing with the government.

The government has been trying to put a cap on the fee medical colleges can charge from students in a bid to prevent market forces from dictating the price as in a business venture. A Cabinet meeting last year had capped the fees for the MBBS undergraduate course at Rs 3.85 million in the Kathmandu Valley and Rs 4.24 million outside. However, colleges have been charging an extra Rs 0.5-2 million under different headings. For this fiscal, the fees for the MBBS course have even been jacked up to Rs 4.02 million for Nepali students in Kathmandu's medical colleges and to Rs 4.44 million to colleges outside the capital. The medical colleges have, however, been demanding they be allowed to charge more and also admit more students in both the general medicine and dental faculties. The colleges are making hefty profits, even running into billions annually, all at the expense of the students, but they seem to want more.

As one delves deeper into the business of medical education, it becomes apparent that it is beset with serious problems, with business motive overriding quality education. The three medical colleges could have been spared the rod had it furnished the information demanded by the government in time instead of giving threats to shut down the colleges if need be. Medical colleges must abide by the Medical Education Act and the decision of the Cabinet. Much damage has already been done to their image, and they must work to improve on it so as not to be seen as extortionists. It has been learnt that the medical colleges collecting extra fees from the students would be punished as per the laws, and a fraud case is to be filed against them by mid-December. The government has every right to act as per the law, but in doing so let it not scare away potential investors who might be wanting to invest in Nepal. There are discreet ways to bring erring institutions and businesses on track without having to resort to raids.

Enforce the law

Consumption and sale of tobacco products are widespread even in city areas. Local vendors are seen openly selling tobacco items even in front of a hospital or school, restricted under the Tobacco Product (Control and Regulatory) Act, 2011. No one can sell and consume tobacco products at places, such as government offices, educational institutions, health facilities, parks, religious places, theaters and airports. The Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) has also signed an agreement with Healthy Cities, a global network of cities, to save lives by preventing non-communicable diseases.

However, the law has not been fully implemented by the concerned bodies. So KMC and other municipalities must act as per the rules of the law to control the sale and consumption of tobacco products, which are said to be the main cause of lung cancer. According to Tobacco Atlas, more than 27,100 Nepalis are killed by diseases due to consumption of tobacco items. More than 21,000 children and 3,046,000 adults consume tobacco products every day. We can at least discourage them from consuming tobacco items if we enforce the law. Tobacco consumption is considered as one of the major causes of lung ailments.
