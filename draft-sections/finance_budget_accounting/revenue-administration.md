### Revenue administration

The establishment of permanent revenue collection offices in districts in the south was the most important Rana contribution to revenue administration. These offices were the hubs of fiscal administration in the districts. They later emerged as one of the three main pillars of district administration, along with the District Administration Office and the District Court.

Most government revenue came from the land tax, and the rates were based on productivity, irrigation facilities, and geographical location. Land in the hills was placed in four categories, abal, doyam, sim and chahar, while in the Tarai, revenue was collected on the basis of crops cultivated, productivity, and irrigation facilities. Collection of the land tax was contracted out to the village chief. The establishment of Sadar Mulukikhana during Juddha Shamsher's rule was an innovation comparable to the present day Central Treasury, Financial Comptroller General's Office (FCGO) and Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the country's central bank.

Nepal witnessed numerous innovations in financial management in the 1950s. Among them, the Interim Government Act of Nepal 1951 established the Financial Working Procedure of government, spelled out the obligation to present the annual budget to the Advisory Assembly, and made it mandatory for all members of the assembly to participate in budget discussions. The act spelled out the royal family's prerogatives in matters of expenditure, and had a chapter on the appointment of the Controller and the Auditor General.

The first budget of sorts - Rs 50.25 million - was announced in 1951. A proper national budget specifying 'regular and development' expenditures was first announced in fiscal year 1956/57. A Finance and Income Department was established after 1950. The Customs Commissioner's Office was established in 1957, but was later closed down, and a separate Department of Customs and Excise Duty was established in 1963. The Accountant General's Office under the Ministry of Finance (MoF) was set up in 1951; its primary function was to maintain records of annual income and expenditures, release government funds, and provide training in accounting.

The constitution of 1959 incorporated the concept of fiscal decentralization, and also made provisions for an Auditor General, who was appointed the same year. The Income Tax Act 1962 laid the basis for the system of tax collection. The government introduced the Procedural Regulation for Spending Public Money (1959) to govern public spending. Prior to that, there were no specific rules on how public money could be spent. The government began double entry bookkeeping in 1960.

The Constitution of Nepal 1962 created the Financial Work Procedure Rules, preventing government from levying any tax or obtaining any loan except in accordance with the law. It also required the government to submit the annual budget to the Rastriya Panchayat (legislature). The Payment Accounting System (bhuktani shresta pranali) was also introduced at this time. In 1976, the Accountant General's Office was upgraded to the Financial Comptroller General's Office, headed by a Special Class officer. A separate civil service cadre of accountants was also created under the Nepal Administrative Service in 1978. The District Treasury and Controller's Offices (DTCO) were established nationwide after the enactment of the Public Income/Expenditure Working Procedure Rules 1981. The constitution of 1990 provided for an Auditor General.


The Interim Constitution (2007) makes all taxes and loans subject to law, and also provides for a Consolidated Fund, and "except for the revenues of religious endowments," all revenues received by the government, all loans obtained and all money received in repayment of any loan made under the authority of any act is credited to this fund. Nepal has 14 laws on revenue and expenditure administration.

## Development planning

Development planning is the responsibility of the National Planning Commission (NPC), the National Development Council (NDC), MoF, and the line ministries. These institutions are also involved in the budgeting process. 

### National Planning Commission

The NPC is chaired by the Prime Minister and is the main body responsible for formulating development policies and preparing periodic and annual plans. In addition to exploring internal and external resources and approaches to development, the NPC also provides assistance and advice to other government bodies in formulating, implementing, monitoring and evaluating policies and programs. The NPC has a vice chairperson and seven members, all appointed by the government. The Chief Secretary and Secretary of Finance are ex-officio members. The secretary at the NPC is the member secretary of the planning body.

### The budget process

#### Planning

The Resource Committee of NPC initiates the budget process for the upcoming fiscal year by assessing the resources available for the development budget, based on revenue estimates, forecasts of foreign loans and grants, and the potential for borrowing. The NPC then prepares the budget preparation guidelines, taking into consideration the periodic plan, the Three-Year Expenditure Framework and the government's international commitments. This guideline is sent to the ministries.

Every year by December, the MoF provides the ministries with a budget ceiling, on the basis of which each ministry is required to prepare and submit its proposals for recurring and capital spending by March.

Representatives from the NPC and MoF discuss the submissions with the ministries, including specific line items, while also scrutinizing whether or not their capital budgets are consistent with the objectives of the periodic plan. The budget is sent to the Cabinet after the MoF scrutinizes the regular budget demands. The procedure is completed in four to six months between December and June.

After receiving Cabinet approval, MoF submits the annual estimate of revenue and expenditures for the upcoming year to the Legislature-Parliament in accordance with Article 93(1) of the Interim Constitution. The estimates are presented towards the end of the fiscal year, normally at the end of June or the first week of July. On the first day of the new fiscal year (the first day of the Nepali month of Shrawan, usually July 16), the parliament passes an advance bill to meet ongoing expenditures. The DTCOs, at the request of line offices, release their advance budgets, but these do not exceed one-sixth of the total expenses of the preceding year. The parliament discusses the budgets of all sectoral ministries before approval. budget_chart.jpg illustrates the budgetary process.


#### Implementation

At the beginning of the new fiscal year, upon approval of the budget by parliament, the MoF issues a source book. The source book documents the sources of funding for projects, detailing cash or in-kind grants, loans or direct payments, along with the budget headings and allocations. It also states the government's counterpart fund (or the allocations it makes to match donor support to projects), if any. 

In accordance with the Financial Procedure Act 1998, the Finance Secretary issues a fund warrant letter - a delegation of authority to spend - to all secretaries, along with the approved budget for spending, in accordance with the Financial Procedure Rules 2007. The fund warrant letter details the budget lines, specifying which funds are from the government or from donor agencies.

Under the Financial Procedure Act 1998, the secretary is a ministry's chief accounts officer. The secretary issues fund warrant letters to department or project chiefs to enable them to authorize their subordinate offices to spend the funds. A copy of the letter is also sent to the Auditor General's Office and the concerned District Treasury Control Office (DTCO) to facilitate budget release within the provisions of the warrant letter. It is the responsibility of the heads of offices to spend the budget in accordance with the prevailing law and to get the expenses audited.

Much of the government's budget for recurring and capital spending that is allocated to specific programs is documented in what is known as the Red Book. The MoF also retains a lump sum as unallocated funds to be allocated after the government decides spending on particular programs.

The fund warrant letter is supposed to reach districts at the beginning of the fiscal year,61 but there have been numerous cases where it was sent six or seven months late. As an extreme example, the fund warrant letter for an irrigation program, amounting to Rs. 30 million, was sent to the DTCO, Dang, on July 11, five days before the end of the fiscal year.

### Financial Comptroller General's Office (FCGO)

The FCGO is the department of the MoF responsible for overseeing all government expenditures and consolidating annual financial statements. It also tracks revenue collection and computes other receivables, releases budgeted funds to government agencies on a quarterly basis, and carries out their internal audits through the DTCOs. The FCGO manages four divisions and 14 sections, two central level offices and 75 DTCOs.

The FCGO is required to submit an annual consolidated financial statement
of the government to the Auditor General's Office, along with a description of the total expenditure, amount of budgetary transfer (virement), and the position of the government treasury.

As a comptroller of government accounts, the FCGO grants permission to open imprest fund accounts and other necessary government accounts. Similarly, it directs DTCOs on the release of foreign-aid funds, and releases government funds for projects implemented on a reimbursement basis, usually for loan-funded projects. DTCOs cannot disburse budgets without the authorization by the FCGO.

The DTCOs monitor the expenditures of the line offices. There are about 4,000 fund disbursement centers scattered across the country that are responsible for administering the budget within their units. The government has implemented the Treasury Single Account system on a pilot basis in some districts to improve the management of funds and to help reduce the deficit. Under this system, DTCOs are to make all payments of the line offices within two hours of receiving payment orders along with necessary documents needed for fund release.

### Nepal Rastra Bank

Established in 1956, the NRB is the country's central bank and is responsible for ensuring monetary and financial stability in coordination with the MoF. A committee chaired by the Minister of Finance recommends the appointment of the governor of the central bank. NRB's main functions include issuing currency, formulating and implementing appropriate monetary policy, formulating and implementing a foreign exchange policy and determining a foreign exchange system, managing a foreign exchange reserve, issuing banking licenses, regulating commercial banks and financial institutions and serving as their banker, functioning as a banker, advisor and financial agent of the government, and establishing, promoting and regulating the system of payment, clearing and settlement.

In 2010, Nepal had 30 customs offices, 143 sub-customs units, 23 Inland Revenue offices and 13 service centers.64 The customs administration collects customs duty, Value Added Tax (VAT),65 and excise and others taxes at border points, accounting for about 40 percent of total revenues in 2010. Customs duty contributed about 22 percent of total tax receipts. The revenue collected is enough to pay for more than 50 per cent of the total outlay of each periodic plan.

The government introduced the VAT in 1997 to replace the sales tax, hotel tax, contract tax and entertainment tax, and VAT is today the main source of revenue. The threshold for registering for VAT is Rs 2 million. In fiscal year 2009/10, the government began encouraging taxpayers to obtain Permanent Account Numbers (PAN). By December 2009, 50,763 individuals had obtained PANs. Efforts have continued to broaden the tax net, which now includes real estate transactions. Similar efforts have been undertaken to make customs administration more efficient. The government has recommended setting up a central revenue board as part of ongoing efforts to reform revenue administration.

The major challenges in revenue collection include low collection of taxes, the inability of government to increase the effectiveness of health and education taxes, unscientific customs valuation, non-issuance of bills and receipts, undervaluation of goods and services, evasion of excise duties, and lack of coordination between revenue collection entities. As indicated in the section on the judiciary, case disposition at revenue tribunals is also an area that needs improvement.

## Financial monitoring and control mechanisms

There are a number of provisions in the Financial Procedure Act 1998 that specify the procedures and accountability for budget release. The act makes the secretaries, department chiefs and other authorities responsible for financial administration. The Financial Procedure Act 1998 and Financial Procedure Rules 2007 lay down several control mechanisms, such as the procedures and accountability for virement and the clearance of audit objections, as well as specifying the functions of the FCGO and DTCOs.

The Audit System

Internal Audit

All 75 DTCOs periodically report to FCGO and the Auditor General's Office the budget amount released and spent in the stipulated month or period. According to the Financial Procedure Rules 2007, the DTCOs and the Funds and Account Comptroller's Office must regularly carry out internal audits of all government offices.

Final Audit: The Interim Constitution provides for appointment by the President of an Auditor General to ensure proper use of public funds. Separate rules, regulations and legal provisions govern the Auditor General's Office, particularly the Audit Act 1991. The responsibility of the Auditor General's Office is to enhance good governance through accountability and transparency in the public sector. Its mission is to provide trustworthy, effective and independent auditing for efficient use of public resources. Article 123 of the Interim Constitution empowers the Auditor General's Office to audit the accounts of all public agencies within the executive, legislature and judiciary. The government is also required to consult the Auditor General before appointing auditors to corporate bodies of which it owns more than 50 percent. By law, the accounts of all public agencies must be available for scrutiny by the Auditor General's Office at any time.

The Auditor General submits the report of the audit to the President, who then sends it to parliament through the Prime Minister. In parliament, the Public Accounts Committee is entrusted with scrutinizing public spending and accounts. The Auditor General and officials from the office concerned are also invited to PAC discussions of the audit report.

Nepal has policies and laws in place to ensure proper use of public funds, but they are often ignored in practice, as documented by the annual reports of the Auditor General. And while the budgeting process is straightforward, new programs and projects originate too often in departments/ministries. Mechanisms intended to reflect local aspirations and exploit local knowledge by involving local bodies in the planning process have remained largely ineffective
