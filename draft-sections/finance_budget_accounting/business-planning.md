External stakeholders of non-profit making entity include donors and the clients of the non-profit services. For government agencies, external stakeholders include tax-payers, higher-level government agencies, and international lending bodies such as Asian Development Bank, World Bank etc.

Internally focused business plans target intermediate goals required to reach the external goals. They may cover the development of a new product, a new service, a new information technology system, a restructuring of financing methods or a reengineering of the organization structure. An internal business planning is often developed in conjunction with a balanced scorecard. This allows success of the plan to be measured using non-financial measures. Business planning identifies and targets internal goals, but provides only general guidance on how they will be fulfilled which are called strategic planning.
