## Labor relation and union

Theoretical context and the labour relation

Institutional Pluralism Theory : is related to two alternatives employee relations framework -unitary and pluralist which guide the relations between management and employees in an organization.

Marxist Movement Theory : Marx stressed the inevitable polarized class struggle in industry and society between capitalists and proletariats. For Marxists, IR system is the social relations of production and the dynamics of capital accumulation. For Marxists, the exercise of power and the achievement of authority is a key dynamic in all employment relationship because the employer can never secure total control or achieve complete authority.

Employment Relations Theory : According to this theory the activities such as collective bargaining arise from inside the employment relations system rather than in isolation.

Strategic IR system : This model shows the relationship between business policies and industrial relations system, external environment and performance outcomes.

Concept and purpose of Labour relation

Union influences the Human Resources (HR) policies and practices which are forced to base on the agreement with management.

Unionized (U) and non-unionized (NU) companies have to consider labour relations and practices. Unionized companies' HR manager should be more challenging. Two important terms used are union and collective bargaining (CB).

Union refers to an organization of workers formed to further the economic and social interests of its members. Collective bargaining refers to the negotiation between
employer and union on wages, benefits, hours of work and other terms and conditions of employment in a good faith.

Thus, labour relation refers to a system or combination of rules governing employment and the process, ways and behaviour in which people behave at work.
These rules regulate the behaviour of union representatives, management or employer in process of collecting bargaining.

Labour relations(LR) have been defined as' the rules, processes and mechanisms through which the relationship between employees and employers and their respective representatives, as well as between them on the one hand, and the state and its agencies on the other, are regulated'. Its basic objectives are to balance economic efficiency or organizations with equity, justice and the development of individual: to find ways and means of minimizing and resolving conflict and to promote harmonious relations between and among the actors involved in IR process for the benefits of parties directly involved and for society as a whole.

The regulations and policies of management hierarchy, the laws of any workers hierarchy, the regulations, degrees, decisions,awards or orders of governments agencies.; the rules and decisions of specialized agencies are created by management and workers hierarchies; collective bargaining arrangements and the custom and traditions of the workplace.

Labour relations are guided by rules and regulations, practices, customs, agreements or arrangements and union activities, collective bargaining process and all other state of relations among labour, management and government are also guided by certain rules and regulations. However, with changes in environmental forces, these rules and regulations are changed and finally affects the formation of new types of Labour Relations(LR).

Main Purposes of Labour Relation

i. Determining the power of labour and management to influence each other

The implication of rules and regulations with the interaction of labour and management in the context of collective bargaining will reach an agreement to achieve the goal of the organization.

ii. Collective bargaining

Through collective bargaining, labour and management can achieve their interest in the areas of setting wages, working hours, and working conditions.

iii. Stability and regularity in industry

Actors of L.R/I.R (employee, management, and government) work for common organizational goals which mean stability and regularity in organization.

iv. Institutionalization of relationship

Trade union Act, labour Act and other rules and regulations bring relationship by considering welfare and collective bargaining.

v. Developing meaningful relations

L.R harmoniously tries to bridge the conflicting interest of employer and employees to develop meaningful relation among parties involved in the areas of proper employment relationship elements, such as fair selection, government labour marketing programmes, development of employment rules and career path at the firm and industrial levels.

vi. Increasing communication and participation at work

Traditional collective bargaining,related to pay, incentives, conditions, of work and advent of employment related to flow of communication and employee participation have increased communication and participation at work.

vii. Initiating change in organization

IR practices have become a source of organizational change and is promoting in making a company competitive in the world market.

Processes of Industrial/Labour Relation system:

Processes of IR/LR and collective bargaining include the following steps

Understanding external environment forces, understanding organizational norms and values, understanding organization's history and current structure, analyzing organization's goals and strategies and performance outcomes.

The Actors of an IR system are:

i. Environment (Surrounding world) ii. Three central actors of an IR system : a. employers and other organizations b. employees and their organizations c. the state organizations. These actors create relations in IR system. iii. Ideology

An account of activities of individual actors at different IR levels:
i. Employers and their organizations(Employers,.managers and Employers' association)

ii. Employees' and their organization (Employees, trade unions and organization level unions) have many activities at different IR levels.

iii. State Authorities: State is a powerful actor in IR system. Trade Union, collective bargaining process are guided by legal provisions made by government.

Three levels in State Authorities are:

Top: State authorities; Middle level: labour level; Administrative level: regulate labour standards, worker's participation and individual rights.

Unionism: 'A union is an organization which has the legal authority to bargain and negotiate with employers on behalf of employees on various issues such as wages, working hours, and other conditions of employment.'

'A union is an organization of workers, acting collectively, seeking to promote and protect its mutual interests through collecting bargaining '

Before we examine the activities surrounding the collective bargaining process, it is important to have understanding of the laws that govern the labour-management process, what unions are and how employees unite.

The success and failures of organizational labour's activities in developed countries affect more segments of work force in two ways :a. Firstly since major industries are unionized, unions have major effect on some of the important sectors of economy b. secondly, gains made by unions sometimes spill over into other NU sector of the economy.

Unions may have major impact on wages structure, wage levels, and individual wage determination regardless of whether specific organizations are organized or not.

Unionism comprises employees' collective effort to join together with a view to bargaining, negotiating with management and administrating on various matters to maximize their welfare on the one hand and its changed trends in terms of membership influences and recognition on the other.

HRM practices in an unionized organization consist of following procedures and policies laid out in labour contracts.

The concept of L.R and the collective bargaining process, may mean different things to different individuals depending on their experience, background, and so on.

Reasons of joining Unions

The reasons individuals join unions are as diverse as the people themselves.

i. Higher wages and Benefits:

There is power and strength in members. Unions are able to obtain higher wages and benefit packages for their members than employees would be able to negotiate individually.

ii. Greater Job Security:

Unions provide its members with a sense of independence from management's power to arbitrarily hire, promote, or fire. The collective bargaining contract will stipulate rules that apply to all members, thus providing fair and more unionism treatment.

iii. Influence work rules:

Wherever a union exists, workers can obtain for unfair working conditions. Union is not only a representative of workers but also it provides rules that define changes in which complaints and concerns of workers can be registered. Grievance procedures and rights to arbitration of disputes are examples of practices.

iv. Compulsory membership:

Many labour agreements contain statements that are commonly referred to as union security causes. Membership arrangement ranges from compulsory membership in the union to giving employees the freedom in choosing to join the union.

a. Union shop-compulsory b. Agency shop- not compulsory c. Open shop -workers are free to join a union d. Maintenance of membership -Unionized to administer their operation. They have to pay dues. d. Dues Check off : Dues check off involves the employer deducting unions dues directly from a union members' pay check.

v. Being Upset with management:

In spite of the above reasons, why employees join a union there appears to be one common factor - Management especially the first line supervisor. If employees are upset with the way their supervisors handles problems, upset over how a co-worker has been disciplined etc. They are likely to seek help from a union.

In fact, it is reasonable to believe that when employees vote to unionize, it is often a vote against their immediate supervisor rather than in support of a particular union.

How employees are unionized?

How Union process is organized?

Employees are unionized after an extensive and sometimes lengthy process called the organizing campaign. Efforts to organize a group of employees may begin representatives requesting a union to visit the employees' organization and solicit members, the union itself might initiate the membership drive, or in some cases, unions are using the internet to promote their benefits to workers. The union must secure signed authorized cards from at least 30 percent of employees.

Unionism in terms of bargaining, negotiating and administrating

i. Unionism and employees:
Unionism has strategic importance from the view points of both employees and employers and for the employee, this is a great source of increasing economic benefits and working conditions and ultimately improving the quality of work life.

Economic benefits: Unionized workers have rights to negotiate to increase their economic benefits and incentives. Income of employees leads to job security, economically.

Working Conditions: Unions are helpful to improve working conditions for employees. Working conditions have direct impact on health and hygiene of work force. With the help of union, employees can bargain with the employers for better working conditions.

Quality of Working Life: Unionism has been largely successfully improving QWL. Better QWL is possible after HR conditions and practices like promotion, supervisor-employee involvement, safe working conditions, etc. QWL means employees' need for participation, QC, job enrichment etc.

ii. Unionism and employers:

Union has some strategic importance for the management. Unionism has brought changes in introducing new work system, technology and new working practices. Union can support management by provisional information on problems and working situations.

iii. Government and union

Governmental relation between union and management is an important vehicle for economic development of the nation. A harmonious IR system is the result of good relations between government, employees, and employers. Union works as sister organization of political parties. Relation with political parties determines political stability.

One of the motivations of employees to join unions is to strengthen effort to bargain with management in order to increase the pay benefits, to improve working conditions and to handle other employment relating problems.
