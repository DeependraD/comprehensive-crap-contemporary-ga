 History of Nepal can be categorized into three major periods and are sub-categorized into several other periods as given below: 
1. ANCIENT PERIOD: Ancient period can be divided into 5 dynastical rules. They are given below:

 

1.1 GOPALAS: They were the cow herders who came to Nepal with Lord Shri Krishna and started living in Kirtipur with their cows. It is said that Nepal was named after one of the castes of Gopalas called Nip. After some times of their arrival, a Hermit called ‘Ne’ conferred kingship to landlord’s son of one of the Gopalas as the first king of Nepal. As per the chronology of Wright, Following were the kings of Gopala dynasty of Nepal Bhuktaman, Jaya Gupta, Param Gupta, Bhim Gupta I, Bhim Gupta II, Mani Gupta, Vishnu Gupta, and the last king of this dynasty called yaksha Gupta. They were altogether eight kings and used to run the administration of their country from Matathirtha.

 

1.2 MAHISPALAS: The last king of Gopalas Yaksha Gupta had no children, so the people called Mahispalas from the land between Simraungadh and Janakpur came to Nepal and started ruling the country. They were also called ‘Aabhir’. They were the Buffalo herders of the Rajput dynasty. 

The first king of Mahispalas was Bhul Singh. He ruled for forty nine years in the Nepal valley (Kathmandu valley).  After him, Jaya Singh became the king and ruled for twenty one years. The last king of this dynasty was Bhuwan Singh who ruled Nepal valley for forty one years and the dynasty’s rule ended. The three kings of this dynasty ruled for one hundred and eleven years in Nepal valley. During the rule of these Mahispala kings the border of Nepal was extended to Dudhkoshi in the east, Trisuli in the west, Nilkantha parbat in the north and Chitlang in the south. During the rule of the last Mahispala king Bhuwan Singh, the Kirati from the east annexed Nepal valley under the command of Yalamber and got victory over Mahispalas then Kiranti kings started ruling Nepal Valley. 

 

1.3 KIRAT DYNASTY:  Yalambar was the first king of Nepal valley who founded Kiranti dynasty after defeating the last Mahispala king Bhuwan Singh. He is known as the founder of kiranti dynasty in the history of Nepal. Yalambar is also called Yalung. Kiranti dynasty was supposed to be established in Nepal during the 6th century B.C. there were four prominent kings in this dynasty like Yalamber, Humati, Jitedasti, Sthungko and Gasti. (For detail see Nepalko Samchipta Itihash by Dr. shreeram Prasad Upadhyaya, page number 13 - 14)

  

2. LICCHAVI PERIOD: There are many controversies regarding the founder of Lichhavi dynasty. As per the stone writing (shila lekh) that dates back to 733 A.D. of Jayadev II at Pashupatinath, from the great grandson of Surya, Manu was borned and has written the name of the 12th generation king Supushpadev. After Supushpadev twenty three kings of this dynasty have not been named but only 24th king’s name has been written as Jayadev I. After Jayadev I twelve kings have not been mentioned and after this only Brishdev’s name has been written. But in Gopal Bangsawali all twelve kings’ names have also been written.  The prominent kings of this dynasty were Manadev, Basantadev, Shivadev I, Amshu Verma, Narendradev, Jayadev II, etc. (For details see Nepal ko Samchipta Itihash by Dr. Shreeram Prasad Upadhyaya, page number 15).

 

3. MEDIEVAL PERIOD: The medieval period of Nepal is considered to be from 880 AD to 1768 AD until Prithvi Narayan Shah annexed Kathmandu valley. This long span of period (888 years) is known as medieval period in Nepali history. The period between the beginnings of Nepal sambat to the rise of Jayasthiti Malla is considered as pre-medieval period and the period after this is considered as post medieval period. Pre-medieval period is known as Dark Age because the historical evidences and materials of some years in pre medieval period are not available. During pre-medieval period Nepal was divided into three large nations. They were as follows: Khash Malla state of Karnali region extended from Trishuli in the east to Gadhwal in the west, Simraungadh state of Karnat clan of Tirhut extended from Mansarobar to Southern Terai, Nepal valley and Nepalkhanda were included in these nations. The capitals of these states were as follows: Khash Malla state – Sinjha, Tirhut – Simraungadh, and Nepalmandal – Bhaktapur. (For detail see Nepal ko Samchipta Itihash by Dr. Shreeram Prasad Upadhyaya, page number 25).

 

3.1 MALLA PERIOD: 

After the fall of the Lichchhavis there came the Malla period during which Kantipur city was founded which is now called Kathmandu. The early Malla rule started with Ari Malla in the 12th century and over the next two centuries grew into a large empire before disintegrating into small principalities which later became known as the Baise (twenty-two principalities). This was more or less coincidental with the emergence of the Chaubise (twenty-four principalities). The history of these principalities remains shrouded up until the time when they joined other kingdoms, both large and small, to form the United Kingdom of Nepal.

 

Jayasthiti Malla, with who commences the later Malla period in the Kathmandu Valley, reigned towards the end of the 14th century. Though his rule was rather short, his place among the rulers in the Valley is eminent for the various social and economic reforms such as the 'Sanskritization' of the Valley people, new methods of land measurement and allocation etc. Yakshya Malla, the grandson of Jayasthiti Malla, ruled the Kathmandu Valley until almost the end of the 15th century. After his demise, the Valley was divided into three independent Valley kingdoms -- Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Patan -- in about 1484 A.D. This division led the Malla rulers into internecine wars for territorial and commercial gains. Mutually debilitating wars gradually weakened them and by the time of King Prithvi Narayan Shah’s invasion of the Valley, they had by themselves reached the thresh hold of political extinction. The last rulers were Jaya Prakash Malla, Tej Narsingh Malla and Ranjit Malla of Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur respectively. 

 

4. MODERN PERIOD: The modern history of Nepal can be traced back when Prithvi Narayan Shah annexed the three cities of Kathmandu valley in 1825 B.S. He defeated the rulers of three rulers Jaya Prakash Malla of Kathmandu, Tej Narsingh Malla of Patan and Ranjit Malla of Bhaktapur and declared the capital as Kathmandu and began ruling from Basantapur Darbar or Hanuman Dhoka Palace. The modern periods consist of following dynasties which are described below:

4.2 RANA REGIME: 

The Rise of Ranas: 

King Privthi Narayan Shah created the unified Nepal finally conquering Valley kingdoms in 1825 B.S. and died in 1831 B.S. After his death, the disastrous events began to take place. His successor Pratap Singh Shah ruled for only 2 years and died. Then the political history of Nepal took turn with several regents ruling the country which led to the futile and fragile political situation due to unstable nature of regents and power competition among the groups of courtiers. Taking advantage of such unstable and fragile situation of the country, Junga Bahadur Rana came into power after Kot Massacre in 2nd Aswin, 1903. The Kot massacre took place due to the death of Gagan Singh Khawash who was kknown as the right hand to Rajya Laxmi, the younger queen (Kaanchi Maharani) of Rajendara Bikram Shah. Due to the influence of the cunning ideas of Junga Bahadur to find out the murderer of Gagan Singh, Queen Rajya Laxmi was requested to call an emergency meeting of the courtiers at the middle of the night in which the courtiers attended without weapons. Taking advantage of this right situation Junga Bahadur Rana, who had already prepared his seven brothers and some supporters, killed his entire enemy.

 

Emotions ran high among the assembled bands of notables and their followers, who listened to the queen giving an emotional lecture blaming the Pandes and demanding that the prime minister must execute the Pande leader whom she suspected of the murder. While Abhiman Singh hesitated, fighting broke out in the crowd, and he was wounded. During the free-for-all that followed, swords and knives were used on all sides to dispatch opponents. Through some scheme that has never been explained adequately, the only leader with organized bodies of troops in the kot area was Jang Bahadur, whose troops suppressed the fighting, killing many of his opponents in the process. When the struggle subsided, the courtyard was strewn with the bodies of dozens of leading nobles and an unknown number of their followers--the cream of the Nepalese aristocracy. The Pande and Thapa families in particular were devastated during this slaughter event.

 

Factors that caused the Rise of Ranas:

Ø         Political instability

Ø         Support of East India Company

Ø         Relation of Junga Bahadur’s family with the Royal family

Ø         Marital relation with the Royal family

Ø         Royal approval of 24th Shrawan, 1913 (Surendra Bikram Shah) 

Ø         The Parvas (massacre)

 

Political instability: The political situation after the death of Prithvi Narayan Shah was characterized by political conspiracies against each other that implies to kings or queens, or the courtiers who wanted to influence either kings or queens to gain power in the palace. Taking advantage of minor king and haphazard and careless behavior of regents, the groups of courtiers (Pandeys, Thapas, Kunwar, Ranas, and others) happened to build hostility among them in the process of gaining power in the palace. Due to this, the kings, queens and courtiers in the support of each other indulged in the conspiracies for power. Besides these, the army commanders who returned from the battle of Anglo-Nepal war also indulged in the political hatching of conspiracies. Such political instability led the way to rise of the dictator, Junga Bahadur Rana. 

 

Support of East India Company: After signing the Sugauli Treaty in 1873 B.S. with British East India Company following the Anglo-Nepal war, the Nepalese politics was significantly influenced by the ambassadors of East India Company. The Ranas and Pandeys were against Thapas particularly Bhimsen Thapa and the two queens of King Rajendra Bikram as well as the English. Ranas were most importantly supported by English to come to the power and they knew that unless the English were happy they would not be able to sustain their autocracy so they provided invaluable support to suppress the Sepoy mutiny in India and not only this they sent huge numbers of army to fight against its enemy countries during the First World War, just to please the English people in India. That’s why; it is not simply the coincidence that the Rana’s despotic rule came to an end after the independence of India.

 

Relation of Junga Bahadur’s family with the Royal family: Junga Bahadur’s family was in closely touched with the royal family. His grandfather was killed in the battle of Kangada during the Anglo-Nepal War. His father was the bodyguard of King Rana Bahadur Shah who killed Sher Bahadur Shah the murderer of Rana Bahadur Shah. Balnarasingh was appointed as the chief administrator of Dhankuta, Dadeldhura and Jumla in different time of his service to the royal government. Jung Bahadur went with his father as he got transferred to different places and got army training and became lieutenant in young age of fourteen. Later he got the post of captain conferred by King Rajendra Bikram Shah. He also worked as private secretary to the crown prince Surendra Bikram Shah. Due to the murder of the Chautariya Mathavar Singh committed by him, his popularity grew in the palace. Thus, such direct relations with the royal family helped him grow in power with confidence.

 

Marital relation with the Royal family: Keeping in mind the chances of rising in power, Junga Bahadur married Hiranyagarva Kumari, the daughter of Prime minister Fattejung Shah. Furthermore, in order to strengthen his relation with the royal family he arranged the marriage of his two sons (Jagatjung and Jitjung) with the princes of King Surendra Bikram. Later he gave away his two daughters in marriage with prince Trailokya. Due to these relations Jung Bahadur went on climbing the ladder of national social status and finally easily achieve political power. 

 

Royal approval of 24th Shrawan, 1913: King Surendra was a puppet in the hand of Junga Bahadur. King Surendra conferred him the title of Shree Tin Maharaja singing him as the king of Lamjung and Kaski through royal approval on 24th Shrawan, 1913 B.S. Then as a king of two places he could take any type of decision regarding appointment and dismissal of officers, infliction of punishments and formulation of laws. These favorable situations gave him opportunity to become trust worthy to royal family members and rise as dictator.

 

The Parvas (massacres): 1. Kot Massacre: The mass murder of the courtiers at the middle of the night in Hanumandhoka palace (Basantapur palace) that took place on 2nd Ashwin, 1903 known as Kot Massacre. There are different opinions of the historians regarding this murder event, some believe that it was the effect of conspiracy hatched by Junga Bahadur Rana to fulfill his own personal interest of reaching to the powerful post and become an important person in the palace.            While other believe that why the Kot Massacre took place has never been established, although the queen herself was obviously at fault for calling the assembly and whipping it into a frenzy. It has always seemed suspicious that the king was notably absent when the fighting began and that Jang Bahadur was the only leader who was ready for trouble. The extent of the carnage was apparently unexpected. Jang Bahadur was the only true beneficiary of the massacre and became the only military leader in a position of strength in the capital. However, this event of homicide was not only limited to the mass killing of high level courtiers, who ever assembled in the court of the Basantapur palace in order to find out the culprit who had murdered Gagan Singh who was the private person of Queen Rajyalaxmi, in other hand, it was the beginning of the Rana family rule. In this massacre, the prime minister, Chautariya Fatejung Shah and General Abhiman Singh Basnet and many other high level courtiers and soldiers were mercilessly killed. Thus, after Kot Massacre Jung Bahadur was appointed as the commander in chief of the Nepalese army. 

 

Bhandarkhal Parva: The event of mass killing of the courtiers that took place on 23rd Kartik, 1903 B.S. in Bhandarkhal garden is popularly known as Bhandarkhal Parva. It was thought to be the consequence of Rajya Laxmi’s conspiracy to kill Junga Bahadur Rana when he disagreed on enthroning her son Ranendra Bikram who was not the crown prince. The queen absolutely wanted to make her son Ranendra Bikram Shah, a king instead of Surendra Bikram Shah, the legitimate crown prince. But, Junga Bahadur was sternly against the idea of Rajya Laxmi to enthrone her son in the throne of Nepal. Thus, she plotted an evil design of killing Junga Bahadur Rana with the help of her supporters including Gagan Singh Khawash’s family. Being informed about this conspiracy, Junga Bahadur with the help of his seven brothers and six platoons of soldiers managed to kill all of his opponents in the Bhandarkhal garden. Among those murdered during the massacre were the Basnets, Pandeys and others who seemed to be the opposing forces of Junga Bahadur. The queen was accused and charged with many crimes and she was exiled from the country for her good by Junga Bahadur (she was sent to Banaras). Rajendra Bikram Shah, the king who was devoted to his younger wife also went with her to Banaras after appointing Junga Bahadur Rana as prime minister of Nepal. Thus, Junga Bahadur had another successful step for rising as the dictatorship.

 

Alau Parva: Rajendra Bikram Shah, who was staying in Banaras, was planning to come to power again against Junga Bahadur. The persons who ever were sent to kill Junga Bahadur were arrested with evidences and jailed or executed mercilessly. As a result of this incidence, Junga Bahadur dethroned Rajendra Bikram Shah and enthroned Surendra Bikram Shah as the king of Nepal. Rajendra Bikram was outraged with this action of Junga Bahadur and left Banaras to declare war against him. But Junga Bahadur knew it and prepared his soldiers to fight against with the king. On 13th Shrawan, 1904 B.S. the soldiers of Rajendra Bikram were stationed in Alau near Birgunj but the solders of Junga Bahadur abruptly attacked them and killed all the opponent soldiers and the king was brought to Bhaktapur as the prisoner and declared life sentence. Therefore, all these successful Parvas provided favorable situation to Junga Bahadur and established his family rule without any opponents then after.
