## Budgeting

\begin{questions}

\question What is budget? Describe the weakness of Nepal's budgetary system.

\begin{solution}

National (Government) budget is a document prepared by the government or other political entity presenting its anticipated revenues and proposed spending for coming fincancial year. Nepal's budgeting system is a combination of top-down and bottom-up approach, which brings about a synergy between the national level plans and local level needs; and ensures that the budget fulfills the demands of both the state and the locals.

Normally, the process of budget formulation in Nepal would begin in January and end in July, when the fiscal year starts. However, with the provision of the Constitution of Nepal, 2015, the budget cycle has been moved forward to be presented on the date of 15th Jestha (May 28).

The budget formulation steps can be generalized into four phases:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Preparation
\item Enactment/legislation
\item Execution
\item Auditing
\end{enumerate}

The first step in formulating a budget is forecasting, wherein the sources of revenues and tentative areas of expenditures are identified. The process of forecasting is led by a Resource Committee (RC), which is chaired by the Vice Chairperson of National Planning Commission (NPC), and includes other members from NPC, members from Ministry of Finance (MoF), Central Bank of Nepal and the Financial Comptroller General Office (FCGO). The RC determines the size of budget by analyzing overall economic situation of the country with the help of macro-economic indicators. Once the forecast has been prepared, it is presented to the budget committee comprising of the members of the NPC and the MoF. The committee, after thourough discussion sets the budget ceiling, which limits the budget expenditure based on sectors and availability of resources. The committee also prepares the working guidelines for budget formulation. Thereafter, each of the line ministries is asked to submit their programs and budget estimates (both capital and recurrent) in accordance to the guidelines and sectoral budget ceilings. The line ministries then forward the guideline along with the budget ceiling and priorities to respective departments and agencies functioning under it, either at the district level or at the central level. Based on the guidelines, these agencies prepare the forthcoming year's programs and budget and send it back to the concerned departments. The departments compile the programs and budget of all agencies under them and submit it to the respective line ministries. Some negotiations can take place between Ministries and the departments before it is vetted and consolidated by the Ministers and forwarded to the MoF and NPC for finalization.

Planning -- Devolved programs are financed by the center but fall under the administrative purview of the District Development Committees (DDC), hence the process of budget formulation is different from top-down budgeting. The NPC sends guidelines to DDCs for district level plans and programs. The guideline is passed down to the VDCs and Municipalities, who hold village/town council meetings to discuss and prepare sector-wise development programs and projects. Interest groups such as the consumer committees, NGOs, political leaders, and citizens are included in these discussions. Their plans are then forwarded to the VDC/municipality where it gets accumulated. Once the VDC scrutinizes and gives a green signal to the plan, it moves up to the District Council which re-examines the budget and forwards it to the DDC. The DDC then hold meetings with district offices and finalizes district budget and priorities, which is then sent to the NPC and the Ministries. While this is the process that should be theoretically followed, it is not necessarily fully operated because of absence of popularly elected offcials. As departments are not given a sectoral budget ceiling, they generally do not take expenditure limitations into account; insted they look at project-specific targets as a guide for the budget.

Enactment -- Once the MoF receives the budget from all line ministries, inter-ministerial meetings are held to vet and finalize the national budget. Similarly, the NPC discusses all the programs submitted by the Ministries, and finalized those programs in consideration of the relevancy, budget allocation, and budget handling capacity of the Ministry. Before the budget is presented in the parliament, the parliamentarians are presented with a draft budget document for them to discuss the sector-wise specifics. The comments and queries that arise during the ministry-specific discussions are discussed in detail until the relevant ministry and parliamentarians are satisfied with the clarifications provided to their queries. The budget is presented by the government only after the ministry level budget discussion ends. If the majority agrees with the budget then it is approved and is presented to the national Parliament in the form of a Budget Speech by the Minister of Finance.

Execution -- It is also called the procedure of releasing budget. The process of fund release starts with the approval of the budget by the parliament. Two further steps are required after the parliamentary approval of the budget:

\begin{itemize}
\item Finalization of work programs consistent with the ratified budget for each spending unit by the respective line Ministries and their approval by NPC
\item The formal delgation (through official notification) of authority to spend by the Secretary of Finance to sectoral Ministries and then to project managers.
\end{itemize}

Immediately after completion of the discussion on the underlying principles and policies, the Finance Ministries puts before the parliament the Vote on Account Bills, which authorizes the government to spend a specified amount in advance. The process of releasing budget is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Whereas up to one-third of the previous year's expenditure was often released under the advance bill past fiscal years, the government can now advance up to one-third of the budget for core projects, two-third or one-sixth for remote projects and one-sixth for regular and other programs. Subsequent release can follow after the Appropriation bill gets of the Head of the State assent. Budget release will be made on monthly basis. In the past, trimester budget release was in practice. However, the Financial Comptroller General Office (FCGO) has maintained the trimester and lump sum system for subsidies (DDC, VDC, Education, health, Public corporation, Companies), controlled budget (Medical care, gratuities and others).
\item For donor-funded projects, budget will be released on a pre-funding (donors have to put deposit to GoN, treasury in advance) and reimbursement basis (applied for loan-financed projects and to some extent for bilateral donor-financed projects depending upon the agreement.)
\item The system of imprest account established under ADB and WB-financed projects have also been maintained under which the project authority can withdraw directly from the said account.
\end{enumerate}

After the approval of the Appropriation bill, MoF will inform the entire sector ministries on the project details of the approved budget, and send the sources book on foreign aided projects and letter of authority for all expenditures to all ministries, FCGO and Auditor General's Offices (AGO). Line ministries also forward such budget details and authority latter for expenditure through their concerned Department/Project Coordinator Offices (PCO) to the district line agencies with copies to the FCGO and each District Treasury Offices (DTO).

\begin{itemize}
\item The Department/PCO prepares the unit/wise program supported by budgetary details both source-wise and items-wise and forward it to the NPC and line agencies. In that process, the central level projects will be approved by the NPC and the district level projects by the ministries concerned.
\item After the approval of the program as maintained in (a) the Department/PCO make available to each unit under it the program and budgetary detail. Then each project unit and PCO submit the monthly release reports along with copies of the approved program and authority letters giving budgetary details to the nearest DTO.
\end{itemize}

The FCGO and DTO play important role in the budget release process. The DTOs process all request and will release the funds requested to respective agency's bank account. DTO releases the fund upon the receipt of the following documents:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Authority letter from the concerned ministry,
\item Release order to DTO by FCGO,
\item Project/program duly approved by NPC and document in the budget,
\item The FCGO release funds on a monthly basis, provided the above mentioned conditions are fulfilled and the budget requests tally with the sources book,
\item DTO release the fund only after receiving the statement of expenditure of the previous month from the requesting agency,
\item DTO is also empowered to release the donor portion budget on a reimbursement basis, if so provisioned in the sources book,
\item In the case of pre-funding arrangement in the sources book, budget is released to the extent of donor contribution available.
\end{enumerate}

Auditing -- The final phase of budget cycle is auditing. This is the overall responsibility of the Auditor General (AG) to prepare the annual report after accomplishing auditing of all government transaction. The AG presents its annual report to GoN, which is later forwarded to parliament for discussion and implementation.

### Stages in budgeting

#### Planning

The Resource Committee of NPC initiates the budget process for the upcoming fiscal year by assessing the resources available for the development budget, based on revenue estimates, forecasts of foreign loans and grants, and the potential for borrowing. The NPC then prepares the budget preparation guidelines, taking into consideration the periodic plan, the Three-Year Expenditure Framework and the government's international commitments. This guideline is sent to the ministries.

Every year by December, the MoF provides the ministries with a budget ceiling, on the basis of which each ministry is required to prepare and submit its proposals for recurring and capital spending by March.

Representatives from the NPC and MoF discuss the submissions with the ministries, including specific line items, while also scrutinizing whether or not their capital budgets are consistent with the objectives of the periodic plan. The budget is sent to the Cabinet after the MoF scrutinizes the regular budget demands. The procedure is completed in four to six months between December and June.

After receiving Cabinet approval, MoF submits the annual estimate of revenue and expenditures for the upcoming year to the Legislature-Parliament in accordance with Article 93(1) of the Interim Constitution. The estimates are presented towards the end of the fiscal year, normally at the end of June or the first week of July. On the first day of the new fiscal year (the first day of the Nepali month of Shrawan, usually July 16), the parliament passes an advance bill to meet ongoing expenditures. The DTCOs, at the request of line offices, release their advance budgets, but these do not exceed one-sixth of the total expenses of the preceding year. The parliament discusses the budgets of all sectoral ministries before approval. budget_chart.jpg illustrates the budgetary process.

#### Implementation

At the beginning of the new fiscal year, upon approval of the budget by parliament, the MoF issues a source book. The source book documents the sources of funding for projects, detailing cash or in-kind grants, loans or direct payments, along with the budget headings and allocations. It also states the government's counterpart fund (or the allocations it makes to match donor support to projects), if any. 

In accordance with the Financial Procedure Act 1998, the Finance Secretary issues a fund warrant letter - a delegation of authority to spend - to all secretaries, along with the approved budget for spending, in accordance with the Financial Procedure Rules 2007. The fund warrant letter details the budget lines, specifying which funds are from the government or from donor agencies.

Under the Financial Procedure Act 1998, the secretary is a ministry's chief accounts officer. The secretary issues fund warrant letters to department or project chiefs to enable them to authorize their subordinate offices to spend the funds. A copy of the letter is also sent to the Auditor General's Office and the concerned District Treasury Control Office (DTCO) to facilitate budget release within the provisions of the warrant letter. It is the responsibility of the heads of offices to spend the budget in accordance with the prevailing law and to get the expenses audited.

Much of the government's budget for recurring and capital spending that is allocated to specific programs is documented in what is known as the Red Book. The MoF also retains a lump sum as unallocated funds to be allocated after the government decides spending on particular programs.

The fund warrant letter is supposed to reach districts at the beginning of the fiscal year, but there have been numerous cases where it was sent six or seven months late. As an extreme example, the fund warrant letter for an irrigation program, amounting to Rs. 30 million, was sent to the DTCO, Dang, on July 11, five days before the end of the fiscal year.

### Types and importance of budget

**Approved budget**: An approved budget as defined by NPSAS, 2076 reflects the anticipated revenues or receipts expected to arise in the annual or multi-year budget period based on current plans and the anticipated economic conditions during that budget period, and expenses or expenditures approved by a legislative body, being the legislature or other relevant authority. An approved budget is not a forward estimate or a projection based on assumptions about future events and possible management actions which are not necessarily expected to take place. Similarly, an approved budget differs from prospective financial information which may be in the form of a forecast, a projection or a combination of both - for example, a one year forecast plus a five year projection. 

In some cases budgets may be signed into law as part of the approval process. In other cases, approval may be provided without the budget becoming law. Whatever the approval process, the critical feature of approved budgets is that the authority to withdraw funds from the government treasury or similar body for agreed and identified purposes is provided by a higher legislative body or other appropriate authority. The approved budget establishes the expenditure authority for the specified items. The expenditure authority is generally considered the legal limit within which an entity must operate. In some cases, the approved budget for which the entity will be held accountable may be the original budget and in others it may be the final budget.

**Original budget** may include residual appropriated amounts automatically carried over from prior years by law. For example, governmental budgetary processes include a legal provision that requires the automatic rolling forward of appropriations to cover prior year commitments. Commitments encomapass possible future liabilities based on a current contractural agreement. In some cases, they may be referred to as obligations or encumbrances and include outstanding purchase orders adn contracts where goods or services have not yet been received.

Supplemental appropriations may be necessary where the original budget did not adequately envisage expenditure requirements arising from, for example, war or natural disasters. In addition, there may be a shortfall in budgeted receipts during the period, and internal transfers between budget heads or line items may be necessary to accomodate changes in funding priorities during the fiscal period. Consequently, the funds allotted to an entity or activity may need to be cut back from the amount originally appropriated for the period in order to maintain fiscal discipline. The **final budget** includes all such authorized changes or amendments.

**Actual amounts** is used to to describe the amounts that result from execution of the budget. In some cases, "budget out-turn", "budget execution" or similar terms may be used with the same meaning as "actual" or "actual amounts".

NPSAS applies to all entities that are required to, or elect to, make publicly available their approved budget(s). While making comparison of budget and actual amounts, presentation in the financial statements of the original and final budget amounts and actual amounts on a comparable basis with the budget, which is publicly available, will complete the accountability cycle by enabling users of the financial statements to identify whether resources were obtained and used in accordance with the approved budget.

\begin{questions}

\question What are different types of budget? What are the needs and importances of government budget ?

\begin{solution}

A budget can be of three types
\begin{itemize}
\item Balanced budget: when government receipts are equal to the government expenditure.
\item Deficit budget: when government expenditure exceeds government receipts. A deficit can be of 3 types: revenue, fiscal and primary deficit. A budget deficit occurs when an individual, business or government budgets more spending than there is revenue available to pay for the spending, over a specific period of time.
\item Surplus: when government receipts exceed expenditure.
\end{itemize}

Need and importance of a government budget
\begin{enumerate}
\item Planned approach to government's activities
\item Integrated approach to fiscal operations
\item Affecting economic activities
\item Instrument of economics policy
\item Index of government's functioning
\item Public accountability
\item Allocation of resources
\item GDP growth
\item Elimination of poverty
\item Reduce inequality in distribution of income
\item Tax and non-tax receipt
\end{enumerate}

\end{solution}

\question What do you mean by periodic plan ? What are the major strategies adopted by the ongoing periodic plan (2073/74-2075-76) ?

\end{questions}

## Taxation

In 2010, Nepal had 30 customs offices, 143 sub-customs units, 23 Inland Revenue offices and 13 service centers.64 The customs administration collects customs duty, Value Added Tax (VAT),65 and excise and others taxes at border points, accounting for about 40 percent of total revenues in 2010. Customs duty contributed about 22 percent of total tax receipts. The revenue collected is enough to pay for more than 50 per cent of the total outlay of each periodic plan.

The government introduced the VAT in 1997 to replace the sales tax, hotel tax, contract tax and entertainment tax, and VAT is today the main source of revenue. The threshold for registering for VAT is Rs 2 million. In fiscal year 2009/10, the government began encouraging taxpayers to obtain Permanent Account Numbers (PAN). By December 2009, 50,763 individuals had obtained PANs. Efforts have continued to broaden the tax net, which now includes real estate transactions. Similar efforts have been undertaken to make customs administration more efficient. The government has recommended setting up a central revenue board as part of ongoing efforts to reform revenue administration.

The major challenges in revenue collection include low collection of taxes, the inability of government to increase the effectiveness of health and education taxes, unscientific customs valuation, non-issuance of bills and receipts, undervaluation of goods and services, evasion of excise duties, and lack of coordination between revenue collection entities. As indicated in the section on the judiciary, case disposition at revenue tribunals is also an area that needs improvement.

### Income tax

Income tax is a tax imposed on individuals or entities (taxpayers) that varies with respective income or profits (taxable income). Income tax is generally computed as the product of a tax rate times taxable income. Taxation rates may vary y type or characteristics of the taxpayer.

Income tax is a kind of direct tax that has implications for earnings, expense and savings of a person or organization. Therefore, this forms an important toolbox in economic policy of the government. If the income taxation is low, this on one hand encourages savings of individuals and organizations while on the other promotes investement in infrastructures thereby orienting economy towards growth. However, excessive tax burden on taxpayers lead to poor saving behaviour and discourages capital expenditure. Hence income tax plays a significant role in a coutry's economic growth and stability.

Likewise, differential taxation scheme (progressive taxation), which advocates for low taxes to low income generating individuals and high rates to high income generating individuals, can be a useful aid in filling in the gap between two income groups thereby helping foster social justice. Majority of nations worldwide take into consideration the abovementioned ideas in order to formulate policy and laws regarding income tax.

VAT

1. Introduction

In Nepal, Value Added Tax (VAT) was introduced on 16 Nov. 1997. This tax was levied in place of the Sales Tax, Hotel Tax, Contract Tax and Entertainment Tax. However, it could not be implemented fully until the FY 1998/99 due to political instability and strong opposition from the business community.VAT replaces the old Sales Tax, Contract Tax, Hotel Tax and Entertainment Tax. It has been designed to collect the same revenue as the four taxes it replaced. Since the collection of both customs duties and income tax depends, to a great extent, upon the effectiveness of VAT, it is expected to help enhance revenue collection.

(VAT) is a broad-based tax as it also covers the value added to each commodity by a firm during all stages of production and distribution. It is a modern tax system to improve the collection of taxes, to increase efficiency and to lessen tax evasion. It is also regarded as the backbone of income tax system in Nepal.The current threshold for VAT registration is Rs. 2 million. Those vendors whose annual turnover is below the threshold can, however, register voluntarily.There is a persistent increase in the number of VAT registrants. IT has crossed the 40,000 mark. At the time of conversion from the then existing sales tax to VAT, a total of 2045 taxpayers were converted as VAT registrants. As the taxpayers are increasing, the amount of revenue collection and the level of tax compliance is improving today.

2. How does it Work?

VAT is a tax imposed on the value added to goods and services consumed in Nepal or exported outside. The tax is based on the principle that each producer or distributor adds value, in some way, to the materials they have purchased and it is this added value that is taxed at each stage of the production and distribution chain. There is the presumption that VAT is shifted forward completely to the Consumer. In the VAT system, producers, distributors and people providing services raise VAT on the products or services sold or provided. The difference between the VAT collected on sales and the VAT charged on purchases determines the amount a registrant must remit or the amount that may be claimed as a refund. In other words, if the tax on sales is more than the tax on purchases, the dealer / businessman remits the difference. If the tax on sales is less than the tax on purchases, the dealer may carry forward this credit to the next month.

3. What is an input tax credit ?

Registered businessmen are obliged to collect and remit VAT on their taxable transactions. These registrants are entitled to recover the tax paid on their purchases. This recovery or refund is known as input tax credit. The Input Tax Credit (ITC) is the total of the tax paid or payable on taxable goods and services purchased in Nepal, and the tax paid on taxable goods imported into Nepal. Where VAT is paid or payable by a registrant on a purchase or on imports, the registrant is allowed to claim input tax credit for those purchases made by the registrant in his commercial activities. However, even though the purchase of goods or services may relate in part to a commercial activity, in certain circumstances the purchase may not generate input tax credit entitlement when he sells goods or services which are tax-exempt.

Most registrants are entitled to claim input tax credits for the tax paid on acquisitions of capital goods for use primarily in commercial activities. Unlike the income tax deduction rules, the input tax credit for any VAT paid on capital goods is not amortized over the life of the asset. It can be claimed in full in the period in which it is acquired. If the capital goods are later put to a non-commercial use, special change-of-use rules will apply. Taxpayers whose export is more than 50% of total sales or those who are continuously on 6 months credit may claim for refund. Refund shall be made within 30 days from the receipt of refund claim.

4. What is taxed and what is not?

VAT divides all goods and services into two basic categories, taxable and tax-exempt. Goods and services are either taxed at the standard rate of 13 percent or they are taxed at 0%. Those taxed at the standard rate include all goods and services except those which are specified as taxed at 0% or tax-exempt.

5. What Is Tax-Exempt ?

The purchaser will NOT pay VAT on tax-exempt goods and services and the supplier is not allowed input tax credits on purchases related to the following goods and services:

(a) Goods and services of basic needs which include rice, pulses flour, fresh fish, meat, eggs, fruits, flowers, edible oil, piped water, wood fuel.
(b) Basic agricultural products are also tax-exempt, for example, paddy, wheat, maize, millet, cereals and vegetables.
(c) The expense of buying goods and services required to grow basic agricultural products are tax-exempt. This includes live animals, agricultural inputs including machinery, manure, fertilizer, seeds, and pesticides.
(d) Social welfare services including medicine, medical services, veterinary services and educational services.
(e) Goods made for the use of disabled persons.
(f) Air Transport.
(g) Educational and cultural goods and services such as books and other printed materials, radio and television transmissions, artistic goods, cultural programmes, non-professional sporting events and admissions to educational and cultural facilities.
(h) Personal services are also tax-exempt. These are services provided, for example, by actors and other entertainers, sportsmen, writers, translators and manpower supplies agents.
(i) Exemption from VAT is also extended to the purchase and renting of land and buildings
(j) Financial and insurance services.
(k) Postage and revenue stamps, bank notes, cheque books.

6. Are Imported Goods Taxed?

The VAT Act, Schedule I lists imports which are tax-exempt. Some of these include prescription drugs, basic groceries, medical devices and agricultural products. Most imports, however, are fully taxable at customs point. Thereafter these are treated on the same basis as domestically produced goods.The VAT on imported goods is collected by Customs. It is calculated on the dutiable value of the goods, in other words, on the value of the goods including transportation, insurance, freight and commissions PLUS any duty or other taxes (other than VAT) payable on the goods. The value for the duty of the goods is determined in accordance with the valuation provisions contained in the Customs Act.

Registrants may claim input tax credit for the VAT paid on imported goods used in their commercial activities.

7. Are Exports Taxed ?

VAT is applicable only to the consumption of goods and services in Nepal. However, supplies made in Nepal that are exported are taxable at 0%. Exporters are allowed to claim input tax credits for VAT paid or payable on purchase of goods and services relating to their commercial activities. Exports taxed at 0% include exports of both goods and services.

8. Who must register ?

Registration is required for any business:

(a) With an annual taxable turnover of more than 2 million rupees.
(b) Belonging to a conglomerate which has an aggregate annual taxable turnover exceeding 2 million rupees.

9. Who is affected by VAT?

In addition to consumers, persons involved in commercial activities are affected by VAT. A person means an individual, firm, company, association, cooperative, institution, joint business, partnership, trust, government body or religious organization.

There are categories of persons and organizations which are not required to collect VAT nor allowed to claim a refund of the VAT they have paid in producing their goods and services for sale. These would include unregistered small suppliers, that is, persons with annual sales of taxable goods and services of Rs. 2 million or less. But even such people con voluntarily register for VAT purposes.

10. What factors are taken into account when determining annual sales of taxable goods and services ?

In assessing the value of taxable supplies a vendor must include the value of the supplies taxed at the standard VAT rate and his sales of supplies sold at 0% (the zero rated supplies). Sales of exempt supplies will not be included. If he has had or expects an abnormally large sale he should contact his IRO to determine if this sale should be taken into account when calculating his need to register.

11. Can Small Businesses Register?

Businesses with taxable annual sales of under 2 million rupees may apply to register. If a business chooses to register, it must remain registered for a full fiscal year.

12. Who May Apply to Cancel Their Registration?

A VAT registration may be cancelled by anyone whose total taxable sales for four consecutive calendar quarters is not more than 2 million rupees and who has been registered for a full fiscal year or by persons who no longer has a commercial activity because of bankruptcy, receivership, or cessation of the business.

13. What are the obligations of VAT registrants ?

VAT registrants are required to:
(a) Submit VAT return and pay tax within the 25th day of the following month.
(b) Provide their customers with a tax invoice.
(c) Maintain Purchase Book, Sales Book, VAT Account.
(d) Keep their VAT records for a period of 6 years.
(e) Inform the IRO of changes to the business including new address, telephone number or a reorganization of a partnership within 15 days.
(f) Put their Certificate of Registration in the premises where customers may easily see and read it.
(g) Allow tax officers to enter the business to examine the business records and the stock on hand.

14. What is a taxpayer required to put on his tax invoice?

The tax invoice will require the name and address of the seller and the purchaser, the seller`s PAN number and invoice number, the date of the transaction and a description of the sale including the number of items purchased, the unit cost of each item and a mention of any discounts given.

The tax invoice must be prepared in three copies and the first copy should be clearly identified as a tax invoice. The original copy is to be given to the purchaser, the second copy is to be retained for audit purposes while the bottom copy is for use by the seller in preparing a record of the transaction.

15. What is an abbreviated invoice?

Tax Officers may grant permission for a VAT registrant to issue an abbreviated invoice for retail sales below the value of Rs. 5000.The chief difference between the two tax invoices is that an abbreviated invoice does not require the name and address of the purchaser.The registrants have the right to request a detailed tax invoice as they will not be able to claim input tax credits with abbreviated invoices. IRD may order taxpayer to issue invoices by using cash machine or computer. The procedure in such case shall be as prescribed by the DG of IRD.

IRD will have anytime access to the database of the taxpayer.

16. Is it necessary to maintain a special accounting system ?

Most businesses will require only minor modifications to their record keeping. In order to complete his VAT return a taxpayer will need to ensure that his books and records provide:

1. The amount of VAT paid on purchases.
1. The amount of VAT collected on sales.
1. A method of distinguishing between taxable and exempt sales.
1. The time the goods and services were supplied.
1. Evidences that goods were exported, if any.

17. What books and records must be kept?

A taxpayer must keep the following books and records :

1. A purchase book,
1. A sales book, and
1. A VAT accounts.

18. What is to be included in the purchase and sales book?

Purchase and sales books include:

1. The invoice number
1. The invoice date
1. The supplier`s name and PAN number in the purchase book
1. The customer`s name and PAN number in the sales book
1. The taxable value, and
1. The amount of VAT.

Businesses which sell both taxable and exempt goods will need to complete additional columns of information to separate exempt sales and the purchases related to them. IROs will be pleased to provide taxpayers with a sample Purchase Book (Schedule 8) and a sample Sales Book (Schedule 9) format. PAN number refers to the Taxpayer Identification Number which will be allocated to each registrant after completion of the registration process.

19. What is the VAT account ?

The VAT account is a monthly summary showing the source of the figures used in the VAT return. This account contains purchases and sales and the VAT spent and collected. A sample VAT Account (Schedule 7) may be obtained from the concerned IRO.

20. Offences

Fines will be imposed if the taxpayer fails to file his return within the specified time.A registrant will make his VAT payment at a bank where he will receive a bank voucher as proof of payment. This number is to be entered on his VAT return to be submitted within 25 days after the end of the month of business transaction.

The VAT Act imposes fines for failing to register. Similarly, if a registrant fails to use his registration number or clearly display his registration certificate in the business premises, he is liable to fine.

Other penalties may be imposed if, for example, a registrant fails to file a return, issue invoices, keep an up-to-date account of transactions, obstructs visits by a tax officer in investigation, prepares false accounts and invoices or attempts to evade tax. Similarly, IRO/IRD may purchase or cause to purchase under invoiced goods.

21. Administrative Review

A taxpayer who is not satisfied with the Tax Assessment of a Tax Officer may submit an application to the DG of IRD for administrative review within 30 days from the time of receiving such decision.

22. Tax Plate

In order to make public the status of the registered taxpayer automatically, each registered taxpayer is required to display the tax plate which is visible from outside in the premises of the taxpayer. The size and the colour of the tax plate should be as follows:

A. Size: The size of the tax plate should be 30 cm long and 10 cm width.
B. Information to be shown on the tax plate:
- Permanent Account Number (PAN)
- Taxpayer`s Name.

C. Colour : The tax status of the taxpayer will be identified on the basis of the following background and the colour of the tax plate:
- Bush green background and letters in white colour: VAT registered tax payers.
- Lemon yellow background and letters in black colour: Tax payers dealing in VATable goods and services but whose transaction is the below threshold i.e. Rs. 2 million per year.
- Signal red background and letters in red colour: Tax payers dealing in non-VATable goods and services.

23. Conscious Consumer Lottery Programme

In order to encourage billing system and thereby improve the tax system and motivate the consumers to take bills on the purchase of goods and services and motivate the sellers to issue bills on the sale of goods and services, a conscious consumer lottery programme has been introduced since Magh, 2060.

Types of bills to be included in lottery programme.

a. Purchase bill issued by VAT registered taxpayers to consumers who are not registered in VAT.
b. Tax invoice or abbreviated tax invoice in the name of natural person among individual purchasers who are unregistered.
c. All types of bills except the purchase of vehicle ( excluding bicycle) and star hotel will be allowed to participate in the program.

However, bills issued in the name of government authority, public enterprises, local level authorities and diplomatic missions and the bills issued by the public enterprises will not be entertained in the programme.

The prize will be declared once a month on the basis of coupons distributed in that month.

Procedures of conducting lottery programme:
- IRD will print lottery coupons with serial numbers of two copies.
- A separate number will be marked in each coupon.
- One coupon will be issued to the purchaser after receiving the purchase bill of Rs. 1,000 and a copy will be retained by the contractor conducting the program. For instance, if a consumer submits 3 bills containing the purchase of Rs. 400 each, he will receive one coupon and will be eligible to get another coupon in each additional amount of Rs. 1,000. However, surplus amount will not be entertained for the purpose of competition once coupons are issued after submission of the bills.
- The bills worth less than Rs. 250 will not be entertained in the programme.

Provision of Cash Prizes to sellers:
In order to motivate the sellers to give bills to the buyers, those sellers whose invoices have enabled the cash prizes to the consumers will also get the following cash prizes:

- First winner - 1 Seller Rs. 25,000
- Second winner - 5 Sellers (Rs.5,000 each) Rs. 25,000
- Third winner - 10 Sellers (Rs.3,000 each) Rs. 30,000
- Consolation Prize - 20 Sellers (Rs.2,000 each) Rs. 40,000

24. Proxy Criteria

Taxpayers whose annual turnover is more than Rs.2 million are required to register in VAT compulsorily. Taxpayers who fall below this limit will be required to register in VAT within 30 days of their annual transaction reaching or crossing Rs.2 million. However, if the tax payer falls under any one of the following proxy criteria, he is required to register in VAT compulsorily:

a) If the stock of the tax payer exceeds the specified amount when the tax officer inspects the stock or if the monthly sale exceeds Rs. 2 lakh or more during a month;
b) If the annual expenses of the tax payer on the telephone and the rent exceeds Rs. 1 lakh; or
c) If the premises of the taxpayer lies within the specified area of the market or the street as specified by the Department (IRD).

### Taxation and Governance

Paying reasonable tax to the state is a civic duty of good citizens. They do so in return for the life-saving goods and services they get. Tax through coercion is justified for the robust government's role in the economy, production and supply of public goods, creation of a fairer society based on equity and justice and control free-riders. The classical ideal of democracy evoked "no taxation without representation." But the political limit of the government implies that consent of citizens is vital in any policy innovation. It affirms the democratic spirit of the principle of affected. Nepal's media have now spurred a heated debate on the political implications of raising and expanding visible tax base by three-tiered governments - federal, provincial and local- without prudent planning and ignoring its impacts on the life on of ordinary beings.

Local units are collecting extra revenue to sustain fiscal federalism and finance growing public expenditures. The Constitution of Nepal clearly outlines single taxation system, not the double one and, therefore, spending on good causes need to be streamlined through the setup of Fiscal Commission. Many local representatives, unaware of their tax jurisdiction, seek well defined laws and rules. The Inter-Governmental Financial Management Act has fixed the proportional distribution of revenue and the royalty of natural resources. What is unspecified is which province and local body is entitled to what amount.

The lack of clarity about economic path, due process and rate of tax collection by different layers and same layers in different scales continue to violate tax rules by stealth, bred malaises in the tax system and increased financial costs for doing business. Some kinds of harmonisation and standardisation in the determination of tax and due diligence are essential to balance the stock of revenue and policies of social justice. The taskforce, set up by Finance Ministry, now aims to settle the prevailing tax anomaly. The question is how can Nepali polity which has already maximised the cost of governance with huge size of politicians and bureaucracy fulfil Nepalis expectation of public goods.

Optimal redistribution of the capital income to the poor can provide them incentives to work harder and augment the power of polity and build its capacity to reduce poverty and inequality. Tax, however, distorts incentive if the income of society is low and the nation is economically less unified. To measure capital income is hard if there are double book-keeping of companies and firms and tax and revenue administration is riddled with a number of loopholes and seductive incentives, reflecting poor transparency and law-enforcement. Only accountable governance can create fair opportunity for all citizens and utilise tax for overall progress.

The howls of anguish of Nepali Congress (NC) against new tax regime manifests in its pledge of not imposing tax in NC dominated local bodies. Some Gaonpalikas and municipalities have already decided not to enforce tax on birth, death and marriage registration, migration, necessary services and wage labour of the poor. What is and how much is taxed depends on the ability of citizens. Business community who had earlier rebelled against value-added tax is not cheerful either. It wants to see the proper utilisation of tax money. The federation of Gaonpalikas has advised its members to review the taxation system while non-ruling left parties hit the street defying it and price hike on essential goods favouring radical egalitarianism. Ordinary citizens, haunted by tax increase, feel that it does not match their income level and services they get from the regime. They fear that it will be used for socially undesirable activities such as purchase of luxury goods, high cost vehicles and increment of perk, travel costs and allowances for normal meetings of local authorities.

The share of tax in Nepal's GDP is about 23 per cent. Strong tax base of the state can give national leadership adequate policy space for the grasp of welfare measures and reduce the level of misery. Money moving from top-down via progressive taxation of wealthy can develop social welfare benefits to Nepalis and finance the wages of low income groups on health, education, income, contributory social security, social protection of vulnerable, unemployed and support the dignity of work and universal measures. By contrast opponents of progressive tax believe that it reduces incentive to increase income and investment and causes capital flight control of which is vital to drive investment in the nation's productive sectors of economy.

The constitutional right to secure proportional redistribution and equalisation measures through Natural Resource and Fiscal Commission marks the seal of good governance and affirms the belief that proportional taxation of wealth can contribute to the quality of governance in Nepal. The general tendency is that tax avoidance and tax evasion persist among the high income groups especially those engaged in property markets including intellectual property. Taxes imposed on the income of factors of production such as land, labour, capital, technology, etc. increases the cost of production while tax on the consumption of public goods raises the prices where poor can ill afford.

In this sense, introduction of any tax, direct or indirect, must sensibly match with the ability of citizens to pay. The Constitution of Nepal has promised all welfare provisions from the right to work to food sovereignty, expanded more rights to the citizens and made populist promises during the elections. But the fiscal capacity of Nepali state to fulfil them is weak. The nation since 1990s adopted revenue-based, not production oriented economy, infecting food crisis, misery, violent conflict and migration of youth. The rollback of Nepali state cut in public subsidy to agriculture and privatisation of public industries imposed a burden on the poor facing food scarcity and robed the soul of its social democratic constitution. Lowering of corporate tax did not increase either saving for productive investment or broad-based economic growth. The gross domestic saving as percentage of GDP is about 9 per cent. Nepal always faced a conflict between constitutional ideals of justice and usual biases of powerful actors prompted by private profit, privilege and distribution of income at higher ups.

Taxation influences the governance effectiveness in many ways. The first is strong tax base of the nation provides Nepali government a degree of autonomy to engineer the vision, laws, policies, priorities and institutional design. It does not have to depend on external advice, financial resources to execute development projects and run meritocratic administration. The second is large share of finance in the budget from the tax makes the government accountable downward to the citizens. If bulk of revenue comes from remittance or foreign aid which Mike More calls "strategic rents," it undermines the mandate of the government to serve citizens and would be interested in sending its citizens abroad in the hope of hopping remittance to finance budget and trade deficits, soaring debt and mitigate inflation.

For long, Nepali government did not care about tax for losing popular support and received large non-tax incomes from foreign aid and investment. This broke political leadership fiscally free from taxpaying Nepalis and less receptive to address their problems. Similarly, non-tax unearned money flowing through foreign businessmen, INGOs, NGOs, civil society, private foundations, solidarity support groups, sponsors of social movements and charity-based organisations have provided leadership additional incentives and leverage to work for the expansion of their own political constituencies, patronage and clientalist networks rather than work for the mobilisation of domestic resources for productive use and generate welfare benefits for Nepalis. It bred corruption. Businessmen, easy with tax-loopholes, are successful to thwart progressive tax with the help of bureaucracy, lawyers and political patronage and stifled redistribution which is the central appeal of democratic governance to peddle the prosperity of the poor.

Erosion of Nepali state' monopoly on power and its ability to create security and business-friendly environment hamstrung to effectively collect revenues. The tax base of Nepali state is inadequate to sustain polity and acquire, utilise and keep power autonomous of either dominant interest groups of society or powerful business lobby and even donors to set a context for sustainable development. This is why Nepal's political class is weak to build up the political and institutional capacities of the state for effective governance that can manage both demand and supply, formulate and implement development policies, create public order and engage fully in resilient rebuilding of this troubled nation.

In a crisis time, building the financial capacity of Nepali state and its institutions is vital to enable it to perform basic state functions and transcend geopolitical constraints and conditionalities that contest national prerogatives. The liberal economic policy of Nepal permitted self-disclosure of tax admitting the non-interventionist nature of state. But many business houses collude with certain sections of rent-seeking bureaucrats and politicians which has neutralised the action of all branches of governance in favour of tax-emption and choked governance effectiveness in service delivery.

The ability of Nepal state to enforce law and order and foster national integrity system of economic and political institutions rests on the autonomy of Nepali regime from strategic rents, unearned and non-tax revenue. It enhances the responsiveness of governance. How government uses tax money transparently and yields positive outcome of development matters for political legitimacy. It is, however, absurd to think that a government fully dependent on taxation for revenues will be more effective and responsive to citizens' needs. The system of checks, monitoring and impact assessment are equally essential both for the efficient collection of tax and its proper use in the public and national interest.

Tax reform in Nepal should introduce high rate of value-added tax on luxurious goods and abuse of tax laws. If a government imposes steep taxes coercively without welfare guarantee in return then it can easily spoil state-citizen relations, underpin poor governance and inflict distrust on public institutions and officials. National leadership in Nepal faces some disincentives to tax coercively owing to its tangible political costs manifesting in contradiction, resistance and opposition. It must assess the public mood, foresee political consequence and understand whether new tax regime veers to welfare regime as per the Constitution or converts into an extractive state that enriches few elites at the cost of many. Democracy is a distributive regime, therefore, its leadership should open possibility to consult citizens on what is suitable tax for Nepal. This can minimise Nepal's perpetual legitimacy crisis, dependence on aid, crisis of trust on governance and turn the nation successful.

## Public finance and regulatory bodies

### Financial monitoring and control mechanisms

There are a number of provisions in the Financial Procedure Act, 1998 that specify the procedures and accountability for budget release. The act makes the secretaries, department chiefs and other authorities responsible for financial administration. The Financial Procedure Act 1998 and Financial Procedure Rules 2007 lay down several control mechanisms, such as the procedures and accountability for virement and the clearance of audit objections, as well as specifying the functions of the FCGO and DTCOs.

### Public auditing

Internal Audit: All 75 DTCOs periodically report to FCGO and the Auditor General's Office the budget amount released and spent in the stipulated month or period. According to the Financial Procedure Rules 2007, the DTCOs and the Funds and Account Comptroller's Office must regularly carry out internal audits of all government offices.

Final Audit: The Interim Constitution provides for appointment by the President of an Auditor General to ensure proper use of public funds. Separate rules, regulations and legal provisions govern the Auditor General's Office, particularly the Audit Act 1991. The responsibility of the Auditor General's Office is to enhance good governance through accountability and transparency in the public sector. Its mission is to provide trustworthy, effective and independent auditing for efficient use of public resources. Article 123 of the Interim Constitution empowers the Auditor General's Office to audit the accounts of all public agencies within the executive, legislature and judiciary. The government is also required to consult the Auditor General before appointing auditors to corporate bodies of which it owns more than 50 percent. By law, the accounts of all public agencies must be available for scrutiny by the Auditor General's Office at any time.

The Auditor General submits the report of the audit to the President, who then sends it to parliament through the Prime Minister. In parliament, the Public Accounts Committee is entrusted with scrutinizing public spending and accounts. The Auditor General and officials from the office concerned are also invited to PAC discussions of the audit report.

Nepal has policies and laws in place to ensure proper use of public funds, but they are often ignored in practice, as documented by the annual reports of the Auditor General. And while the budgeting process is straightforward, new programs and projects originate too often in departments/ministries. Mechanisms intended to reflect local aspirations and exploit local knowledge by involving local bodies in the planning process have remained largely ineffective.

### Financial Comptroller General's Office (FCGO)

The FCGO is the department of the MoF responsible for overseeing all government expenditures and consolidating annual financial statements. It also tracks revenue collection and computes other receivables, releases budgeted funds to government agencies on a quarterly basis, and carries out their internal audits through the DTCOs. The FCGO manages four divisions and 14 sections, two central level offices and 75 DTCOs.

The FCGO is required to submit an annual consolidated financial statement
of the government to the Auditor General's Office, along with a description of the total expenditure, amount of budgetary transfer (virement), and the position of the government treasury.

As a comptroller of government accounts, the FCGO grants permission to open imprest fund accounts and other necessary government accounts. Similarly, it directs DTCOs on the release of foreign-aid funds, and releases government funds for projects implemented on a reimbursement basis, usually for loan-funded projects. DTCOs cannot disburse budgets without the authorization by the FCGO.

The DTCOs monitor the expenditures of the line offices. There are about 4,000 fund disbursement centers scattered across the country that are responsible for administering the budget within their units. The government has implemented the Treasury Single Account system on a pilot basis in some districts to improve the management of funds and to help reduce the deficit. Under this system, DTCOs are to make all payments of the line offices within two hours of receiving payment orders along with necessary documents needed for fund release.

### Nepal Rastra Bank

Established in 1956, the NRB is the country's central bank and is responsible for ensuring monetary and financial stability in coordination with the MoF. A committee chaired by the Minister of Finance recommends the appointment of the governor of the central bank. NRB's main functions include issuing currency, formulating and implementing appropriate monetary policy, formulating and implementing a foreign exchange policy and determining a foreign exchange system, managing a foreign exchange reserve, issuing banking licenses, regulating commercial banks and financial institutions and serving as their banker, functioning as a banker, advisor and financial agent of the government, and establishing, promoting and regulating the system of payment, clearing and settlement.

### Revenue administration

The establishment of permanent revenue collection offices in districts in the south was the most important Rana contribution to revenue administration. These offices were the hubs of fiscal administration in the districts. They later emerged as one of the three main pillars of district administration, along with the District Administration Office and the District Court.

Most government revenue came from the land tax, and the rates were based on productivity, irrigation facilities, and geographical location. Land in the hills was placed in four categories, abal, doyam, sim and chahar, while in the Tarai, revenue was collected on the basis of crops cultivated, productivity, and irrigation facilities. Collection of the land tax was contracted out to the village chief. The establishment of Sadar Mulukikhana during Juddha Shamsher's rule was an innovation comparable to the present day Central Treasury, Financial Comptroller General's Office (FCGO) and Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the country's central bank.

Nepal witnessed numerous innovations in financial management in the 1950s. Among them, the Interim Government Act of Nepal 1951 established the Financial Working Procedure of government, spelled out the obligation to present the annual budget to the Advisory Assembly, and made it mandatory for all members of the assembly to participate in budget discussions. The act spelled out the royal family's prerogatives in matters of expenditure, and had a chapter on the appointment of the Controller and the Auditor General.

The first budget of sorts - Rs 50.25 million - was announced in 1951. A proper national budget specifying 'regular and development' expenditures was first announced in fiscal year 1956/57. A Finance and Income Department was established after 1950. The Customs Commissioner's Office was established in 1957, but was later closed down, and a separate Department of Customs and Excise Duty was established in 1963. The Accountant General's Office under the Ministry of Finance (MoF) was set up in 1951; its primary function was to maintain records of annual income and expenditures, release government funds, and provide training in accounting.

The constitution of 1959 incorporated the concept of fiscal decentralization, and also made provisions for an Auditor General, who was appointed the same year. The Income Tax Act 1962 laid the basis for the system of tax collection. The government introduced the Procedural Regulation for Spending Public Money (1959) to govern public spending. Prior to that, there were no specific rules on how public money could be spent. The government began double entry bookkeeping in 1960.

The Constitution of Nepal 1962 created the Financial Work Procedure Rules, preventing government from levying any tax or obtaining any loan except in accordance with the law. It also required the government to submit the annual budget to the Rastriya Panchayat (legislature). The Payment Accounting System (bhuktani shresta pranali) was also introduced at this time. In 1976, the Accountant General's Office was upgraded to the Financial Comptroller General's Office, headed by a Special Class officer. A separate civil service cadre of accountants was also created under the Nepal Administrative Service in 1978. The District Treasury and Controller's Offices (DTCO) were established nationwide after the enactment of the Public Income/Expenditure Working Procedure Rules 1981. The constitution of 1990 provided for an Auditor General.

The Interim Constitution (2007) makes all taxes and loans subject to law, and also provides for a Consolidated Fund, and "except for the revenues of religious endowments," all revenues received by the government, all loans obtained and all money received in repayment of any loan made under the authority of any act is credited to this fund. Nepal has 14 laws on revenue and expenditure administration.

### Public expenditure and financial accountability

\begin{questions}

\question What is meant by public expenditure and financial accountability ?

\begin{solution}

\textbf{Historical Overview}

PEFA began in 2001 as a means to harmonize country level assessment of public financial management (PFM) across the organizations that established the program. Those organizations were the European Commission, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and the governments of France, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. They remain the custodians of the program and have supported PEFA through four phases of implementation.

PEFA was established as a means to reduce the duplication and costs of multiple assessments and to facilitate dialogue between government and others about how to improve the effectiveness of fiscal policies. PEFA was also aimed at improving the results of development cooperation as part of the global aid effectiveness agenda. It provided support for the Strengthening Approach established in 2005 through the Paris Declaration, then further developed in the Accra Agenda for Action in 2008, and the Busan Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation in 2011.

Effective institutions and systems of public financial management (PFM) play a crucial role in the implementation of national policies concerning development and poverty reduction. Good PFM is the linchpin that ties together available resources, delivery of services, and achievement of government policy objectives. If it is done well, PFM ensures that revenue is collected efficiently and used appropriately and sustainably.

PEFA introduced a standard methodology and reference tool for PFM diagnostic assessments. It was extensively discussed and tested between 2001 and 2005 with the aim of harmonizing the needs of government and their development partners for a common analytical tool and shared data. The first publicly available version of PEFA was launched in 2005 and reports for Afghanistan and Zambia were produced in that year. 

Since the early assessments in 2005 PEFA has been used more than 500 times in 150 countries. It has become the acknowledged standard for PFM assessments and has amassed a pool of data comprising over 40,000 individual performance scores.

\textbf{PEFA Program Phases}

To date there have been four phases of the PEFA program. The current phase began in July 2012.

\begin{itemize}
\item Phase I (2002-2005): Development
\item Phase II (2006-2008): Dissemination
\item Phase 1II (2009-2012): Integration
\item Phase IV (2012-2017): Global Public Good

## Accounting system

\begin{questions}

\question What is the accounting system in practice in Nepal ? What are the features of double entry system of bookkeeping ?

\begin{solution}

An accounting system allows a business to keep track of all types of financial transactions, including purchases (expenses), sales (invoices and income), liabilities (funding, accounts payable), etc. and is capable of generating comprehensive statistical reports that provide management or interested parties with clear set of data to aid in the decision-making process.

The \textbf{new accounting system} is the present accounting system of government of Nepal which keeps the systematic record of all revenues and expenditures of the government offices performed through the bank. It is the systematic and scientific system for recording all the revenue and expenditures of government offices. It was implemented since 2019/20 in phase wise basis. In 1993 BS, Biratnagar Jute Mill used the double entry system for the first time in private sector. This system emphasizes on banking transactions and is based on double entry system, which keeps the record, according to budget heads in prescribed forms.

The objectives of new accounting system, as recommended by the Account Committee, 2017 are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Maintenance of systematic accounting of financial transactions
\item To provide information about funds and their utilization
\item Safeguarding physical properties
\item To make auditing simple and economical
\end{itemize}

Double Entry System Concept

If each and every financial activity is recorded by using the rule of debit and credit then such modern, systematic, scientific and fundamental concept of accounting is called double entry system. It has a two-fold effect on the accounting process. The double entry system is a modern system of bookkeeping based on duality principle propounded by Luca De Pacioli on 1494 A.D. from his book "Summa de Arithmetica" on "Accounting of Venice" chapter. Double entry system prevents accounting frauds errors.

Accounting principle in double entry system of bookkeeping is based on Equation \ref{eq:double-entry-equation} :

\begin{equation}
Assets = Equity + Liabilities
(\#eq:double-entry-equation)
\end{equation}

Features of double entry system of bookkeeping are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item It has a double effect of every financial transaction
\item Equal effect on both sides
\item A complete, scientific and reliable method of accounting
\item Helpful to prevent frauds and errors
\item Flexible for the correction in the process
\item Useful for internal control system
\item Concept of debit the receiver, credit the giver.
\item It keeps the full recording of economic transactions
\item Helpful to make final accounts
\item Easy to analyze and help to make comparable financial statements
\item Complex to understand, time-consuming, expensive and not suitable for small organizations
\item A universally accepted rule of accounting
\end{enumerate}
\end{solution}

\end{questions}

### Nepal public sector accounting standards

NPSAS provides standards for meaningful summarization of financial information. NPSAS has concept to prepare the financial statement of the Government like a private sector entity. NPSAS are in compliance with the Cash Basis International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 2003, updated in 2006 and 2007 developed by Public Sector Committee of International Federation of Accountants (IFAC). Previous reporting was based on different OAG Forms like form no. 9, 193, 194, 17, 208, 210 etc. and therein no information on total fund position and no records for third party transactions were reported. NPSAS, hence gives priority to recording of transactions which are not yet being accounted and reported. (like third party transactions, goods and services received free of cost, etc. NPSAS accrual basis covers total assets and liabilities but several other stages should be followed before accrual implementation, so current NPSAS guidelines resorts to stepwise implementation.

The standard comprises of two parts -- Part 1 and Part 2. Part 1 is mandatory. It sets out the requirements which are applicable to all entities preparing general purpose financial statements under the cash basis of accounting. It defines the cash basis of accounting, establishes requirements for the disclosure of information in the financial statements and supporting notes, and deals with a number of specific reporting issues. The requirements in this part of the Standard must be complied with by entities which claim to be reporting in accordance with the Nepal Public Sector Accounting Standards *Financial Reporting Under The Cash Basis of Accounting*.

Par 2 is not mandatory It identifies additional accounting policies and disclosures that an entity is encouraged to adopt to enhance its financial accountability and transparency of its financial statements. It includes explanations of alternative methods for presenting certain information.

#### Requirements for reporting under the cash basis of accounting

Information about the cash receipts, cash payments and cash balances of an entity is necessary for accountability purposes and provides input useful for assessments of the ability of the entity to generate adequate cash in the future and the likely sources and uses of cash. Reporting cash enhances comparability across and within the entities adopting the cash basis of accounting.

**General purpose financial statements** are those intended to meet the needs of users who are not in a position to demand reports tailored to meed their specific information needs. Users of general purpose financial statements include taxpayers and ratepayers, members of the legislature, creditors, suppliers, the media and employees.

The Preface to Nepal Accounting Standards issued by the Accounting Standards Board (ASB), Nepal explains that Nepal Accounting Standards (NASs) are designed to apply to the general purpose financial statements of all profit-oriented entities. Government Business Enterprises (GBEs) (as defined in paragraph 1.2.1 of NPSAS) are also the profit-oriented entities.

While preparing general purpose financial statements, NPSAS requires the preparation of statement of cash receipts and payments which recognizes the cash controlled by the reporting entity, and the disclosure of accounting policies and explanatory notes. It also requires that amounts settled on behalf of the reporting entity by third parties be disclosed on the face of the statement of cash receipts and payments.

General purpose financial statements should present information that is:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Understandable;
\item Relevant to the decision-making and accountability needs and of users;
\item Reliable in that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Represents faithfully the cash receipts, cash payments and cash balances of the entity and the other information disclosed;
\item Is neutral, that is, free from bias; and
\item is complete in all material aspects
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

**Cash basis** means a basis of accounting that recognizes transaction and other events only when cash is received or paid by the entity.

Financial statements prepared under the cash basis provide readers with information about the sources of cash raised during the period, the purposes for which cash was used and the cash balances at the reporting date. Although the mesurement focus is balances of cash and changes therein, notes to financial statemets may provide additional information about liabilities, such as payables and borrowings, and some non-cash assets, such as receivables, investments and property, plant and equipment.

**Cash equivalents** are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

**Cash flows** are inflows and outflows of cash.

**Cash payments** are cash outflows. **Cash receipts** are cash inflows.

Cash is controlled by an entity (a group of entities comprising a controlling entity and one or more controlled entities) when the entity can use the cash for the achievement of its own objectives or otherise benefit from the cash and exclude or regulate the access of others to the benefit. Cash collected by, or appropriated or granted to, an entity which the entity can use to fund its operating objectives, acquire capital assets or repay its debt is controlled by the entity. Amounts deposited in the bank account of an entity are controlled by that entity.

Government may manage the expenditure of its individual departments and other entities through a centralized treasury function, often referred to as a "single account" basis. Under these arrangements, individual departments and entities do not control their own bank accounts. Rather, government monies are managed by a central entity through a "single" government account or series of accounts. The central entity will make payments on behalf of individual departments and entities after appropriate authorization and documentation. Consequently, individual departments and entities do not control the cash that they have been appropriated or otherwise authorized to expend. In these cases, the expenditures made by individual departments and entities will be reported in a separate column headed "treasury account" (or a similarly described column) in the statement of cash receipts and payments in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 1.3.24(a).

In some cases, the centralized treasury function will be undertaken by an entity which controls the bank account(s) from which payments on behalf of the individual operating departments and other entities are made. In these cases, transfers to and payments from those bank accounts reflect cash receipts and payments which the central entity administers on behalf of the individual operating departments and other entities. Paragraph 1.3.13 specifies that cash receipts and payments which arise from transactions the entity administers on behalf of other entities and which are recognized in the primary financial statements may be reported on a net basis. Paragraph 1.4.9 requires the disclosure of cash balances held by an entity at reporting date that are not available for use by the entity or are subject to external restrictions.

#### Financial statements

An entity should prepare and present general purpose financial statements which include the following components:

1. Statement of cash receipts and payments which:

\begin{enumerate}
\item recognizes all cash receipts, cash payments and cash balances controlled by the entity; and
\item separately identifies payments made by third parties on behalf of the entity in accordance with paragraph 1.3.24 of NPSAS.
\end{enumerate}

2. Accounting policies and explanatory notes; and
3. When the eneity makes publicly avaialble its approved budget, a comparison of budget and actual amounts either as a separate additional financial statement or as a budget column in the statement of cash receipts and payments in accordance with paragraph 1.9.8 of NPSAS.

When an entity elects to disclose information prepared on a different basis from the cash basis of accounting, such information should be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.

**Information to be presented in the Statement of Cash Receipts and Payments**

The statement of cash receipts and payments should present the following amounts for the reporting period:
\begin{enumerate}
\item total cash receipts of the entity showing separately a sub-classification of total cash receipts using a classification basis appropriate to the entity's operations; 
\item total cash payments of the entity showing separately a sub- classification of total cash payments using a classification appropriate to the entity's operations; and basis
\item beginning and closing cash balances of the entity.
\end{enumerate}

Total cash receipts and total cash payments, and cash receipts and cash payments for each sub-classification of cash receipt and payment, should be reported on a gross basis, except that cash receipts and payments may be reported on a net basis when:

\begin{enumerate}
\item they arise from transactions which the entity administers on behalf of other parties and which are recognized in the statement of cash receipts and payments; or
\item they are for items in which the turnover is quick, the amounts are large, and the maturities are short.
\end{enumerate}

Line items, headings and sub-totals should be presented in the statement of cash receipts and payments when such presentation is necessary to present fairly the entity's cash receipts, cash payment and cash balances. Total cash receipts may be classified to, for example, separately identify cash receipts from taxation or appropriation; grants and donations; borrowings; proceeds from the disposal of property, plant and equipment; and other ongoing service delivery and trading activities. Total cash payment may be classified to, for example, separately identify cash payments in respect of: ongoing service delivery activities including transfers to constituents or other government entities; debt reduction programs; acquisitions of property, plant and equipment; and any trading activities.

#### General considerations

1. *Reporting period* The general purpose financial statements should be presented at least annually. When, in exceptional circumstances, an entity's reporting date changes and the annual financial statements are presented for a period longer or shorter than one year, an entity should disclose in addition to the period covered by the financial statements:

\begin{enumerate}
\item the reason(s) for a period other than one year being used; and
\item the fact that comparative amounts may not be comparable.
\end{enumerate}

2. *Timeliness*
3. *Authorization date*
4. *Information about the Entity*
5. *Restrictions on cash balances and access to borrowings*
6. *Consistency of presentation*
7. *Comparative information*
8. *Identification of financial statements*

## Inventory management

Inventory is a quantity or store of goods that is held for some purpose or use (the term may also be used as a verb, meaning to take inventory or to count all goods held in inventory). Inventory may be kept "in-house," meaning on the premises or nearby for immediate use; or it may be held in a distant warehouse or distribution center for future use. With the exception of firms utilizing just-in- time methods, the term "inventory" typically implies a stored quantity of goods that exceeds what is needed for the firm to function at the current time (e.g., within the next few hours). Inventory may includes raw materials, finished goods, work in progress and daily consuming goods.

Inventory is physical goods in store bought for the purpose of the major business activities which hasn't been sent to the workplace. In the case of bank, draft, cheque, ledger, voucher templates and stationary equipments can be taken as inventory.

Inventory is held in organization for three motives. They are:

- Transaction motive -- to facilitate smooth operation. This also means retail/business must have products stocked in order to meet the demands of customer.
- Precautionary motive -- to guard against unpredictable changes. Usually, in manufacturing, runing out of only one item can prevent a manufacturer from completing the production of its finished goods.
- Speculative motive -- to take advantage of price fluctuations

Why inventory leves should not be kept high ?

- Requires large capital investment
- Space usage
- Obsolescence
- Complicates inventory contol system

Why inventory levels should not be kept low ?

- Inventory deficit
- Inefficient usage of human and capital resources

### Inventory management

Inventory management is the management to keep the optimum (not less, not more) level of inventory for the smooth operation of an organization. Broadly, inventory management, or inventory control, is an attempt to balance inventory needs and requirements with the need to minimize costs resulting from obtaining and holding inventory. There are several schools of thought that view inventory and its function differently.

Effective inventory management is all about knowing what is on hand, where it is in use, and how much finished product results. As well as scheduling the inflow and outflow of stocks in the inventory efficiently, assessing cost effectiveness of managing an inventory should factor in three types of costs that constitute total inventory costs: Holding costs (also called carrying costs, that result form maintaining the inventory), set-up costs and purchasing costs.

### Importance of inventory management

- To achieve the organization goal by reducing investment
- To protect make productive use of assets
- To reflect all the records of inventory
- To establish inventory discipline by minimizing the risk of theft, misuse or inventory
- To formulate inventory related policies
- To purchase, use and manage the assets at low cost
- To prepare a base for inventory inspection
- To stop purchasing unwanted goods
- To minimize the risk of stock out and over stock
- To keep the inventory level at a reasonable level

### Addressing the income gap

As a multi-dimensional concept equality means fair treatment of citizens of diverse distinctions. It reduces the gap between the haves and have-nots that scar the Nepali nation. The rationality of equality springs from the equal values attached to each citizen. Democratic virtues foster nationality and humanity of person which is a good worth of citizenship equality and entitled with same welfare provisions. They are the preconditions for freedom. Equality enhances the scale of economic security, wellbeing and dignity, reconciles with social justice and finds its resonance in the constitution. It sets the rules of the game. The unified application of the Constitution in Nepali society coordinates the conflicting conceptions of good life arising out of geographical, genetic, social, economic and cultural diversity, hierarchy and patriarchy. Equality can be measured by the same set of rules of governance for all Nepalis, equal rights, equal opportunity to improve their life-chances and equal welfare to find a life of liberty and progress.

One key challenge Nepali leaders constantly face is the right to equality of citizens enshrined in the Constitution and the actual condition of inequality. This gap between the rich and the poor in Nepal is widening serving as a cause for aspirational politics open to alienation and instability. As a result, Nepali state is unable to muster authority, execute the constitution and stabilise the polity. The tension between Constitutional aspect of welfare state which aims to alleviate the misery of 30 per cent of population below poverty line earning $ 1.90 per day and poor state of redistributive politics owing to inability of Nepali state to finance all rights of citizens remain. In a hierarchy of social, economic and political advantage for certain groups, only equality of opportunity can glue multitude of Nepali citizens and share in a common life.

The welfare state justifies the redistribution of income from capital to workers on moral ground on the basis of capital's income where the contribution of labour is no less significant. The improvement in the living standards of Nepalis can come only through broad-based growth of real economy and investment of surplus on the productive sectors. Economic growth alone does not lubricate the gear of human welfare if its fruits are unfairly distributed, powerful gaining the most and the poor receiving only trickle-down. In the context of growth of democratic awareness, deprivation may feed envy prompting them to engage in radical politics. Well-being across Nepali society can be an effective leveller which can contribute to asset creation and muster ability and capacity to participate in multilevel governance. The meaning of equal rights for Nepalis in the Constitution demands knowledge about it and institutional means to realise them. It provides a sense of security, well-being and dignity and a sense of belonging as a member of the national community, the Nepali state. Economy can grow if natural resource, skilled labour, machineries and infrastructures are optimally utilized and society fully supports its entrepreneurship.

Social justice becomes sustainable with economic efficiency. It can reduce the level of inequality and cope with the negative effects of globalisation. Globalisation frees up the market and intensifies competition among its units but creates disadvantages for those people who cannot compete. This cuts the efficacy of citizenship. In Nepal, the contribution of tax to GDP is little over 15 per cent which is deficient to finance self-sufficient state, fulfil citizens' all rights and raise the living standards of Nepalis. The share of capital to GDP is less than the flow of remittance from the migrant Nepali workers. The annual per capita income of Nepalis stands \$1,000. The minimum wage for worker per month is about \$ 134 but this is inadequate to sustain even a nuclear family. Therefore, the trend of out-bound migration is increasing at a time when post-earthquake resilient rebuilding of this nation needs their active engagement for many years. Annually about 450,000 youth migrate abroad for job and they are source of remittance, entrepreneurship and local economic activities. They contribute 25 per cent to GDP and its benefits are decentralised in all 77 districts. So does its social costs.

Three kinds of inequality pervade Nepali polity - situational inequality, positional inequality and deprivational inequality owing to lack of social, political and economic links. The unjust inequality is awful for economic progress. Democratic politics is designed to reduce the gap in inequality between the empirical facts such as unequal ownership of land and capital and other factors of production that cause misery in Nepali society and adoption of democratic values that is supposed to circulate power, position and wealth across the social classes, gender and generations through a policy embedded in social inclusion, social protection, social security and positive discriminations.

All these concepts embedded in Nepal's constitution call for redistribution from the rich to the poor to meet basic needs, create appropriate jobs, avert social fractures and allow creative pursuit of life. The Constitution demands citizens' part of the sacrifice of their liberty for public security and public order. It is crucial to end the transitional politics and create an egalitarian and just society. This means attainment of public good is necessary. It is a good which does not exclude any Nepalis and can be considered a precondition for social peace. Availability of public good demands both formulation and enforcement of sound public policies based on the spirit of constitution and give a fillip to vital sense of common life. Otherwise, the nation will continue to be trapped in a sort of Greek tragedy where decision-makers do not know the iniquitous consequence of their actions.

One critical aspect of public good in Nepal is public education. It fosters upward mobility by enabling citizens to reclaim control of their destiny and shape the future. Education provides vigilance which is about conscious awareness of one's own living condition and engagement in production and political struggle to improve this. Distribution of intelligence in Nepali society is a must to make its economy competitive and democracy functional. It fosters citizens' desire to innovate and engage in productive life. For example, skilled workers in agriculture increase productivity, reduce any need to migrate abroad for earning and invest more in children's education, health and basic amenities.

Nepal now has a huge pool of skilled workers who have working experience from abroad. Many of them have become entrepreneurs and run their own business and industries. Others have gained skill in the use of modern technology and meet the requirement of Nepalis for human capital equality. Investment in human capital maximises equality, improves the quality of living and meets the need of intergenerational reproduction of human resources. But when financial position is a passport to entry in private education, health, safety, communication and law which poor Nepalis can ill-afford it is hard to gain legal and political equality. Equality before law can only open possibility, not actuality. This is why Nepal's remote and geographically isolated areas face the scarcity of public good such as food, educational and constructional materials, medicine, fertilizers, etc. at a time of amazing growth of private wealth, transport and communication.

Nepal's constitution makes social inequality and discrimination on the basis of caste, gender, region and religion illegitimate. But the unwritten transcript of society continues which needs social reforms and institutional effectiveness to implement laws and set up the supremacy of law over social, economic and political leaders. The social discrimination owing to caste, gender or class inequality has perverse impact on equality. Nepal's social inclusion policy has widened the participation of women, Dalits, and other groups of society in labour market, politics, administration and improved their situation. Only effective institutions can sincerely implement social policies and forestall exclusion. They outlast individual members. But their renewal is important as per the tasks assigned to them by law.

This, however, demands Nepali leaders' political will and commitment. The influence of money on politics has fostered political inequality. Economic equality is a precondition for political equality and civic competence. In Nepal, the proportional representation is dominated by moneyed class, cronyism and interest groups. This bars the inclusion of a large number of micro-minorities and formulate polices to compatible with constitutional spirit. When money becomes a means to peddle influence on politics, authority, law and development policies, low income groups will be trapped in hierarchy and structural injustice and turning their past as a future. They cannot overcome this situation and attain equality in the absence of political solidarity and struggle for equal status.

Building trust among citizens is important to control free-riders, spoilers and predators, who appropriate the resource flow and block the material basis of the egalitarian transformation of Nepali society, economy and polity. For example, gender equality requires transforming the nature of political economy enabling women to gain access to representation, communication, and participation in public sphere, culture, everyday life and recognition of their identity. The debate about democratic equality of Nepali citizens can be initiated and its solution found in the public spheres and public interest, not in selfish promotion of private interests. It can be furnished where government is the solution of the problem of inequality as it has broad-based mandate to take decisions and formulate and implement egalitarian public policies underlined by the spirit of constitution.

One strategy is the use of public funds for reducing inequalities, the other is increasing corporate social responsibilities, still the other is mobilisation of resources, knowledge, skill and technologies of intermediary associations, cooperatives, local government, CBOs, civil society, NGOs and charity-based organizations in alleviating human suffering such as poverty, inequality, joblessness, etc. The golden rule is: elected political leaders who have mandate for change must think outside their partisan interests and work for the general welfare of all citizens.

### Current status of national debt of Nepal

Recently published (March 2020) joint study by WB and IMF of debt sustainability of Nepal using a framework developed for low income countries (LIC-DSF) showed that Nepal remains at low risk of debt distress for both the external and overall public debt.

However, the analysis indicates that Nepal's public debt is projected to gradually increase over the medium-term owing to continuing fiscal and current account deficits, and that debt sustainability is vulnerable to export and economic growth shocks. These findings stress the importance of implementing reforms to increase the economy's resilience to external shocks and to encourage diversification. Further efforts to improve the domestic productivity and competitiveness and to enhance monitoring of risks related to contingent liabilities are necessary to ensure medium-to long-term debt sustainability.

Public debt encompasses central and local governments' debts, government guarantees, central bank borrowings. The NRB borrowed from the IMF through the Rapid Credit Facility and on-lent the funds (about US \$50 million) to the government. Bond issuance by the central bank are only for the purpose of the monetary policy. Recently, mechanism has been developed to provide government as guarantee for debts on behalf of the state owned enterprises (SOEs).

- Nepal's total public debt is estimated at 30.1 percent of GDP at mid-2019.
- External public debt stood at 17 percent of GDP at mid-July 2019.
- Domestic public debt was 13.1 percent of GDP at mid-July 2019.

- The stock of private external debt in Nepal has not been published by the authorities, bu it is estimated to be very small.
- The contingent liability stress test includes contingent liabilites stemming from SOE debt (2 percent of GDP), PPP projects (2.1 percent of GDP) and financial markets (5 percent of GDP).

Growth continued to perform well for the past a couple of years. Due to strong performances in agriculture, reconstruction activities, and tourism, real GDP **growth** picked up to 7.1 percent in FY 2018/19 from 6.7 percent in the previous fiscal year. In the mid-to long-term, it is expected to converge to potential growth of 5.3 percent. The **inflation** rate was 4.6 percent annually in FY 2018/19 and rose to 6.0 percent at mid-July 2019 owing to a surge in food prices, but it is expected to stabilize at 5.3 percent over the medium-term.

The current account deficit was still high at 7.7 percent of GDP in FY2018/19 owing to continued strong import growth. Export and foreign direct investment were still weak, with remittances (a quarter of GDP) helping to finance the large trade deficit. Gross official reserves have fallen to US\$8.5 billion in July 2019, from US\$ 9.3 billion at the end of previous fiscal year. However, the large current account deficit in FY2018/19 did not lead to a commensurate increase in **external** debt or decline in reserves, due to large positive net errors and omissions in the balance of payments (2.7 percent of GDP in FY2018/19). The current account deficit is projected to narrow over the medium-term with slowing import demand. External debt is expected to decrease gradually over the projection period, to 18.5 percent of GDP at mid-2020 and 12percent of GDP by mid-2040.

The primary **fiscal** deficit outturn of the central government in FY 2018/19 decreased to 4.0percent of GDP from 6.1 percent of GDP in the previous year. Even though the FY 2019/20 budget again targets an ambitious increase in spending, the primary fiscal deficit is projected at 3.9 percent of GDP in FY 2019/20, taking into account spending capacity constraints. Over the medium-term, it is projected to decrease to 3.2 percent of GDP.

The Nepalese government is expected to gradually increase domestic borrowing to meet its fiscal deficit. Domestic borrowing is expected to reach 4 percent of GDP annually, and the **domestic debt** stock is projected to increase from 13 percent to 35.5 percent of GDP over the long-term, while external debt stock is projected to decrease to 11 percent of GDP over the projection period.
